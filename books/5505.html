<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to the first <em>Rolemaster Annual!</em> This section of this book will explain what this book is all about and present a summary of major things happening in the <em>Rolemaster Standard System</em>.</p>
<h3>WHAT IS THIS BOOK?</h3>
<p>As the <strong><em>RMSS</em></strong> expands and evolves, many of the master tables become outdated or incomplete. In addition, duplicating old materials to take into account new rules is often not effective in a given book. This book addresses those needs.<br />
What you will find in this book are completely updated master tables (Master Developoment Point Table, Master Training Package Table, and Master Racial Listing) that include all of the material from the <em><a href="5500.html">RMSR</a></em> as well as all RMSS books published in 1996. In addition, you will find character record sheets for the new races and professions introduced in <em>RMSS</em> books published in 1996. Also, some <em>RMSS</em> material published in 1996 was not provided in the perforated and 3-hole drilled pages; that material is repeated here in the more convenient format. Finally, this book contains a complete system-wide index of all the <em>RMSS</em> books published as of the end of 1996.</p>
<h3>NEW RULES AND OPTIONS</h3>
This section contains an overview of some of the new rules and options that were published in 1996.
<h4><a href="5600.html"><span id="arcane">ARCANE</span> COMPANION</a></h4>
<p>Lots of new rules here dealing with <dfn><span id="arcane">Arcane</span></dfn> magic and how to integrate it into a campaign. Specifically, rules for <dfn>Earthnodes</dfn> and <dfn>Ley Lines</dfn> (sources of <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> magic) are given. Rules for <dfn>Bladerunes</dfn> (a special kind of Arcane magic) are also given. Guidelines on how to “control” <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> magic (from a GM’s perspective) are provided. Four new professions (<a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Arcanist">Arcanist</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Wizard">Wizard</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Chaotic">Chaotic</a>, and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magehunter">Magehunter</a>) are detailed as are six new training packages.</p>
<h4><a href="5601.html">TREASURE COMPANION</a></h4>
<p>This book deals with the concepts of treasure of all types. Included are full-blown, detailed rules for all kinds of <dfn>Alchemy</dfn> (and how to incorporate Alchemy into your game). Also provided are guidelines on how to create “random” treasure generation tables (as well as some tables already created). Three new professions are introduced (one alchemist for each realm of magic) as well are rules for “divine” alchemy (to create artifact-type items).</p>
<h4><a href="5523.html">TALENT LAW</a></h4>
<p>In this book, a whole new system for handling background options is presented. This point-based system allows players (under the guidance of their <strong>GM</strong>) to create a completely customized character that fits their background concepts (though there are lots of <strong>GM</strong> cautionary notes here; players will abuse this system if <strong>GM’s</strong> let them). In addition, for ambitious <strong>GM’s</strong>, a system on how to create races that are balanced against the other races in the <em>RMSS</em> is detailed.</p>
<h4><a href="5541.html">RACES &amp; CULTURES: UNDERGROUND RACES</a></h4>
<p>In addition to providing complete racial information for all of the standard undground races (eleven races plus some cultural variants), this book introduces three new concepts: the racial training package, racial talents and flaws, and racial spell lists. These are special items usually only available to characters of the specific race (though guidelines are given to show how non-members can acquire them as well). Lots of new training packages are presented in this book (36 to be exact).</p>
<h4>WEAPON LAW</h4>
<p>This book provides all the basic rules needed to run firearms in a role playing game (more details will be provided in source books for genres; e.g., <em><a href="5700.html">Black Ops</a></em>). Lots of new rules here, but not a lot of new concepts. Included is a master weapon listing of over 600 different weapons. The attack tables are designed so that the 49 different attack tables will cover all firearms attacks from the birth of the firearm to the modern day.</p>
<h4><a href="5542.html">CASTLES &amp; RUINS</a></h4>
<p>This source book provides twenty new training packages (that all deal with folks in and around a castle setting). However, the significant new concept is the training package spell list (a spell list that is associated with a training package, not a profession). Beyond that concept, details and rules for building and running a castle are provided as well. Tables and guidelines on “aging” a structure to the point that it is a ruins are also given.</p>
<h3>ERRATA AND CLARIFICATIONS</h3>
<p>There are several errata and clarifications that have been published for the <em>RMSS</em>. Only a couple of the errata are serious enough to cause system problems (e.g., the accidental ommission of the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Transcend_Armor">Transcend Armor</a> skill, the revision of the Occupation, Everyman, Restricted skill classifications, etc.). All errata are corrected in second and subsequent printings of each book.</p>
<p>Listed below are the major errata for the RMSS.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rules for Occupational, Everyman, and Restricted skill classifications have been simplified (in the <em>RMSR</em>).</li>
<li>The <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Transcend_Armor">Transcend Armor</a> skill was added to the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Power_Manipulation">Power Manipulation</a> skill category (in the RMSR).</li>
<li>The stat bonuses for the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Athletic_Endurance">Athletic &bull; Endurance</a> skill category are incorrect in the Rolemaster Character Records (the ones in the RMSR are correct).</li>
<li>A set of definitions was left out of the <em><a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a></em> definitions.</li>
<li>There are examples that are incorrect in <em><a href="5523.html">Talent Law</a></em> and in <em><a href="5601.html">Treasure Companion</a></em>. The text is correct (the example was not updated to reflect last minute system changes).</li>
<li>The skill of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Driving">Driving</a> was accidentally left out of the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Outdoor_Animal">Outdoor &bull; Animal</a> skill category in the <em>Rolemaster Character Records</em>.</li>
</ul>

<!-- AppleSegStart="GNOLL RACIAL SUMMARY" -->
<a name="Gnoll"></a><h2>Gnoll</h2>
<p>While Gnolls generally inhabit the upper highlands, they seldom seek homes far from the surface. They are not an unfriendly folk, but it does take time before they warm to strangers. Most Gnolls pursue magicial studies and arts, but every tribe has its warriors. It is curious to note that both the males and females have the same basic physical builds.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Short and very quick. The average weight is 75 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Sparse hair, relatively dark in hue. Skin coloration is usually light (though they will darken with prolonged exposure to sunlight). Eyes tend to be dark with only slight variations in color.</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Average height of 3'2".</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 110 years.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Gnolls see well at night. In the dimmest light, they can see 100' as if it were daytime. In addition, Gnolls have an unusual ability to sense shifts in the weather (reflected by a special bonus of +25 to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Weather_Watching">Weather Watching</a> skill).</p>
<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Gnollish clothing tends to be rather mundane and practical (though they do wear brighter garb when secluded from watchful eyes).</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Gnolls tend to be very timid around strangers.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Gnolls are not generally a violent race; nor do they tend to seek material gain. They seek little except to remain at one with the earth and world around them.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> No formal marriages, though long-lasting relationships are common. Families are rarely large.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Gnolls have no formal religion; though they do wor- ship the power of the earth and the might of nature.</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Sometimes deemed overly defensive, Gnolls are remarkably even-tempered. They are often very timid around strangers, but in the company of close friends have been known to be quite sociable.</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> <em>Starting Languages:</em> Gnolls speak their <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Gnoll">own musicial language</a> (S8/W6). They also speak <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Common-speech">Common-speech</a> (S7/W5) and <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Plains-speech">Plains-speech</a> (S7/W5). <em>Allowed Adolescence Development:</em> <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Gnoll">Gnoll</a> (S10/W10), <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Gnome">Gnome</a> (S5/W4), <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Dwarvish">Dwarvish</a> (S5/W4), <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Elvish">Elvish</a> (S6/W5), <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Black-speech">Black-speech</a> (S6/W4), <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Common-speech">Common-speech</a> (S10/ W10), <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Plains-speech">Plains-speech</a> (Rank S8/W6), and <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Hill-speech">Hill-speech</a> (S6/W6).</p>
<p><strong>Prejudices:</strong> Gnolls have the same hatred for violent folk that many races have, and so despise Orcs, Goblins, and others of their ilk. They are suspicious of all strangers, however, and may treat even an Elf with the same disdain as an Orc.</p>
<p><strong>Professions:</strong> Gnolls may freely select any profession in the realm of Arms or Essence (including hybrids and semi-spell users with Essence as a realm). They do not, as a rule, practice Mentalism or Channeling (though exceptions have been noted in their societies).</p>
<p><strong>Training Packages:</strong> Gnolls may normally choose from any of the Training Packages in the RMSS as well as the special Gnoll Training Packages.</p>
<p><strong>Special Skills:</strong> <em>Everyman:</em> any skill in the Subterfuge &bull; Stealth skill category; <em>Restricted:</em> any skill in the Urban skill category.</p>

<h4>OUTFITTING OPTIONS</h4>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Their preferred weapon is the sling, though they have been known to use the short sword, handaxe, dagger, main gauche, warhammer (though rare), club, mace, spear, javelin, short bow, any crossbow (usually light), or bola. Their racial-specific weapons include a tunch and/or a hup.</p>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Any. Gnolls favor lighter armors (particularly leathers).</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 1-2 gold pieces.</p>
<h4>BACKGROUND OPTIONS</h4>

<p><strong>Extra Money:</strong> Gold pieces (of various mints) or small gemstones of comparable value.</p>
<p><strong>Special Items:</strong> Most special items that Gnolls acquire will be utilitarian or stealthy in nature (though they have been known to employ all types of items).</p>
<p><strong>Talents:</strong> See <a href="5541.html#RC:U_6.6.4">Section 6.6.4</a> for Gnoll-specific talents (and guidelines for using them).</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="Kobold" -->
<a name="Kobold"></a><h2>Kobold</h2>
<p>Kobolds are the smallest of the small races. They are viewed with disdain by all races; good and evil alike. However, they have a penchant for flattery and clever speech (and knives in the shadows). Kobolds have made it their life to survive in a world that views them as useless and worthless.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Kobolds are rarely taller than 3' and while similar to Goblins in general, they have less round faces and tend to be much leaner (and of course have no problems with their feet). Both males and females have such similar builds as to be often confused.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Their ruddy skin is often dirty. Their hair is bristly and always dark in hue. Their short horns are lighter in color (but rarely grow long enough to use as an attack form).</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Kobolds have an inner resolve that is rarely displayed. They can go for up to a day and a half without sleep (and then only need half as much rest as a man).</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> A verage 2'10".</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 75 years.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> The hardy system of the Kobold is slightly more resistant to poisons and disease (a special bonus of +5 to RRs versus poison and disease).</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Like all Goblin breeds, Kobolds have the ability to see in dim light (up to100'). In addition, they receive a special bonus of +10 to the Influence skill category (representing their ability to lie, whine, and bemoan their way out of situations).</p>
<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Though the skills of tailoring and weaving are not unknown to the Kobolds, they can rarely make anything that is better than serviceable (they will, however, steal clothes of bright colors from other diminutive races).</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Kobolds fear anyone bigger than themselves (with is practically everyone). The sun is particularly loathed (-75 to all actions while in the sunlight).</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Survival. The Kobolds have become great at it by becoming great at whining, lieing, flattering, etc. Rarely will a Kobold be truly alone (there are usually others waiting in hiding). They will often maneuver themselves into a position as a follower (where they will be quite loyal).</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Marriages are tenuous in Kobold society. Mates are often taken at a whim.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Kobolds have no organized religion, except to fear greater powers (to whom tributes are often paid).</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Almost as a whole, Kobolds are cunning almost beyond compare. They prefer to keep the element of surprise when forced to combat (performing maneuvers that seem unreasonable, just to keep their foes off guard).</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> <em>Starting Languages:</em> <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Goblin">Goblin</a> (S7/W7) and <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Black-speech">Black-speech</a> (S6/W6). <em>Allowed Adolescence Development:</em> <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Black-speech">Black-speech</a> (S8/W8), <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Common-speech">Common-speech</a> (S7/W6), <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Hobgoblin">Hobgoblin</a> (S6/ W6), and <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Hill-speech">Hill-speech</a> (S6/W4).</p>
<p><strong>Prejudices:</strong> Kobolds dislike everyone equally (though fear works wonder on their loyalty).</p>
<p><strong>Professions:</strong> Spell using Kobolds would be quite a rare sight indeed. Channeling users have been reported (though highly rare) and no reports of any Essence or Mentalism users have ever been made.</p>
<p><strong>Training Packages:</strong> Kobolds could conceivably learn any Training Package in the <em>RMSS</em>. In addition, they may select the Kobold Training Packages.</p>
<p><strong>Special Skills:</strong> <em>Everyman:</em> <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Duping">Duping</a>; <em>Restricted:</em> none.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Hobby Skills:</strong> <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Alertness">Alertness</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Ambush">Ambush</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Body_Development">Body Development</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Caving">Caving</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Climbing">Climbing</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Detect_Ambush">Detect Ambush</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Detect_Traps">Detect Traps</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Hiding">Hiding</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Leather-crafts">Leather-crafts</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Lock_Lore">Lock Lore</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Metal-crafts">Metal-crafts</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Metal_Lore">Metal Lore</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Mining">Mining</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Prepare_Poisons">Prepare Poisons</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Setting_Traps">Setting Traps</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Scrounging">Scrounging</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Sprinting">Sprinting</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Stalking">Stalking</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Stone_Lore">Stone Lore</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surveillance">Surveillance</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Trap_Building">Trap Building</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Use/Remove_Poison">Use/Remove Poison</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Wood-crafts">Wood-crafts</a>, any skill in the Weapon group.</p>
<h4>OUTFITTING OPTIONS</h4>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Kobolds are rarely seen in armor (though they have been reported to wear leathers upon occassion).</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 1-10 silver coins of various mints.</p>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Any small, light weapon will be gladly used. Kobolds also have a like of piercing weapons (spears, spiked clubs, etc.).</p>
<h4>BACKGROUND OPTIONS</h4>
<p>Kobolds have six background options.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Languages:</strong> In addition to the tongues listed above: <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Small-speech">Small-speech</a> (S6/W4), <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Black-speech">Black-speech</a> (S10/W10), and <a href="../en.lproj/languages.html#Hill-speech">Hill-speech</a> (S8/W8).</p>
<p><strong>Extra Money:</strong> Rarely would a Kobold have more than a couple of gold coins worth of extra money (and this is usually in an accumulation of lesser valued coins).</p>
<p><strong>Special Items:</strong> Kobolds would only seek out items that enhance their abilities as sneaking liars (though weapons would gladly be taken).</p>
<p><strong>Talents:</strong> Kobolds should re-roll any “spell-user” results. See <a href="5541.html#RC:U_11.6.4">Section 11.6.4</a> for Hobgoblin-specific Talents.</p>

<h1>Rules</h1>
<p>This section provides all of the rules needed for using firearms in any role playing setting. Note that these rules reference that RMSS for normal procedures (only the variances from the normal system are noted).</p>
<h2><a name="Annuals96_3.1">3.1</a> THE SKILLS</h2>
<p>Incorporating the new skills needed for using the information in this book is quite simple. Follow the guidelines below.</p>
<h3><a name="Annuals96_3.1.1">3.1.1</a> WEAPON SKILLS</h3>
<p>Gamemasters merely need to add two new categories to the Weapon group: <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Weapon_1-handed_Firearms">Weapon &bull; 1-handed Firearms</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Weapon_2-handed_Firearms">Weapon &bull; 2-handed Firearms</a>. These two skills both use the stat bonuses of Ag/Ag/St and use standard progressions. The weapon group should have the highest skill cost repeated two more times to account for the new weapon categories.<br />
Note that one skill would be required for each different type of weapon within the category. For example, semiautomatic pistols, revolvers, and blackpowder pistols would all be Weapon &bull; 1-handed Firearms skills. Machineguns, rifles, and muskets would all be Weapon &bull; 2-handed Firearms skills.<br />
Some weapons might be applicable in either category and should be developed separately. For example, firing a semiautomatic shotgun with one hand would require a separate skill from firing it with two hands.</p>
<h3><a name="Annuals96_3.1.2">3.1.2</a> ARMOR SKILLS</h3>
<p>The armor types presented in the RMSS are still valid. However, they represent either medieval or natural armor types. Modern body armors are handled separately and are rated by class.<br />
Class I body armor is made of ballistic cloth and covers only the torso. Class II body armor is similar to Class I in composition, but covers the torso and shoulders (and is generally thicker than Class I armor). Class III body armor covers the torso, shoulders, and thighs and also includes metal inserts (in addition to the ballistic cloth). Class IV body armor covers the entire body and includes many metal inserts.
Skill with modern body armors are developed in the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Armor_Light">Armor &bull; Light</a> category (for body armor types I and II) or <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Armor_Medium">Armor &bull; Medium</a> category (for body armor types III and IV).</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Specific genre books and supplements will introduce other types of armor appropriate to other genres and/or settings.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="Annuals96_3.1.3">3.1.3</a> OTHER SKILLS</h3>
<p>With the addition of firearms into the game, there are several support skills that can be added to the system. These support skills will be detailed in the sections appropriate to the use of the skills. The are listed here for convenience <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Senses">Awareness Senses</a> skill category:</p>
