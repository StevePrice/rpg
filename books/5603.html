<h1><a name="EC_0.0">0.0</a> WELCOME</h1>
<p>Welcome to the <em>Essence Companion</em>. This companion is "theme" oriented. That is, everything in this book centers around a single theme (<span id="essence">Essence</span> magic). If you are not looking to add this theme to your campaign, do not use this book! Also, do not presume what is written on these pages is the absolute rule. Instead, think of it as a text book from which you will learn how to incorporate certain concepts into your game. It is possible that what you learn here will contradict the things that you want to pursue in your game. Remember that when anything is in doubt, the GM' s game takes precedence, not the rules shown here!</p>
<p>The <em>Essence Companion</em> is optional&mdash;everything within it is optional (the professions, the spell lists, etc.). Y our GM must study what is presented here and decide if the concepts are appropriate to his gaming world. Adopting the contents of this book into a game will change the power balance of the game. The GM must decide whether this is good or bad for his game. Because this book is theme oriented, the GM will most likely want to adopt it as a whole or only a very few select pieces. Be very careful when adopting only certain pieces ofthis book into a game, as this book presumes that you are using the whole of the book along with the whole of the rules presented in the <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For readability purposes, this book uses the standard masculine pronoun when referring to persons of uncertain gender. In such cases, these pronouns are intended to convey non-gender specific meanings: he/she, her/him, etc.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="EC_0.0.0.0.1">0.0.0.0.1</a> Authorial Observations</h5>
<p>First ofall, thank you for purchasing this book. Ifyou are standing in the store trying to decide whether or not to buy this book, consider that "thank you" conditional on you forking over the dough. I thank you for purchasing this book because it means that you are not only interested in our ideas, but you are also willing to invest a little time and effort in learning about our ideas. I sincerely hope that you end up spending many more hours enjoying this book than I spent agonizing over all of the details, minutiae and balance issues. While I would like to pre-emptively blame any errors that might crop up in this book on my co-author, I can't. So instead I will blame it on the publishers. Of course, there will be no errors, so you are welcome to ignore both of those comments and move on to the core of the book. Besides, if you are reading this, you have probably owned the book for about four months and never considered reading these comments. If it weren't for the fact that you must have accidentally spilled pizza sauce on the front page, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. Ah, the accidents of life.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I hope that you really do find a lot of useful material for your game. And as a final note, I just want to annotate a comment I made in the Special Thanks of <a href="5542.html"><em>Castles &amp; Ruins</em></a>. I dedicated that book to my son Nicholas Drake Reeves. Since then, his mother Tiffany has graciously agreed to let me change his name. So please go back to your copy of <a href="5542.html"><em>Castles &amp; Ruins</em></a> (buy one if you must) and change his name to Nicholas Drake Kirkland. Thank you.</p>
<p align="right">R.C. Kirkland, Jr.</p>
<p>My thanks upon the completion of this book are many. First of all, I would like to thank my friend and co-author Rich Kirkland. We have been friends for 20 years and played role playing games together for well over half of that. Creating this book with him has been a challenge and a privilege. Not bad for a couple of North Carolina boys whose T-ball team only won one game, huh Rich? Much thanks must also go to my wife, Morgana Moore, whose love and understanding constantly amaze me. Like her namesake, she is truly a beguiling woman. Finally I would like to dedicate this book to the players and characters that make role playing the joy that it is. This book is all about magic, which most people assume does not exist in our world. They are wrong. When a group of friends spend hours creating a world of people and places that exist wholly in their imagination, and they shape the events in that world, that's magic. Now let's play.</p>

<h1><a name="Part_I">Part I</a> CONCEPTS AND PREMISES</h1>
<p>The <span id="essence">Essence</span> is that which is common to all things, living and dead, organic and inorganic. It has been characterized by many names&mdash;The Tao, Magic, the Unified Field, Mana&mdash;and represents a force and order that defines the ways of the world. Changes in the patterns of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> dictate the flow of events, and the course of life itself. <span id="essence">Essence</span> has often been compared to the sustaining and nurturing force of reality itself. A world without <span id="essence">Essence</span> is a stagnant world destined for decay.</p>
<p>The whole of <span id="essence">Essence</span> is a power beyond the grasp of any being, though some students have learned to attune their bodies and minds to the surrounding <span id="essence">Essence</span> in order to use it on a temporary basis. This temporary control allows them to mold elements, twist probability, and wield the very fabric of reality. Though, the spells of <span id="essence">Essence</span> can be both beautiful and lethal, affecting one or many, in the end the normal patterns will always prevail, and only the effects will remain to tell the tale.</p>
<p>Unliving things interfere with the manipulation of the patterns of the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. Inorganic substances, particularly metal, create great difficulties for the manipulation of <span id="essence">Essence</span> and provides strong protection against the powers of <span id="essence">Essence</span>. Being essentially inert, they inhibit the usual extension of one's own <span id="essence">Essence</span>, creating difficulty for the spell user seeking to alter patterns outside the body's immediate sphere. This ability to mold the <span id="essence">Essence</span> is a prerequisite to successful casting of spells. Because of this, users of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> will rarely wear armor or helms while utilizing spells.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/1.0/THEORIES OF ESSENCE" -->
<h1><a name="EC_1.0">1.0</a> THEORIES OF ESSENCE</h1>
<p>Currently, scholars suggest two different theories on the nature of <span id="essence">Essence</span> that they use as models for explaining various principles of spell casting and for use in spell research; they are the <span id="essence">Fluid Essence Theory</span> and the <span id="essence">Radiant Essence Theory</span>.</p><p>The first theory holds that <span id="essence">Essence</span> is like an ethereal fluid or a heavy gas. According to these scholars, <span id="essence">Essence</span> is generated naturally as a by-product of life. All creatures&mdash;plant, animal, and fungus alike&mdash;create Essence just as they produce body heat, scent, and moisture. This fluid energy pools above the ground only slowly seeping into the earth. The fluid flows with the contours of the land and with natural magnetic points on the earth's surface. The strongest of these flows have come to be called ley lines.</p>
<p>The <span id="essence">Essence</span> that slowly seeps into the ground eventually collects in pools deep in the bowels of the earth. Deep in the earth something interacts with the <span id="essence">Essence</span> to cause it to begin a slow rise back to the surface of the earth. The exact cause for the rise of such pools of <span id="essence">Essence</span> is the subject of debate though little truly is known about the reason the <span id="essence">Essence</span> would return to the surface. Some suggest that deep in the earth is the true home of the gods and that the intense heat and power of these beings refines the <span id="essence">Essence</span> into a lighter substance. Some suggest that the <span id="essence">Essence</span> itself changes when under intense pressure, while others suggest that the <span id="essence">Essence</span> hits an impervious surface deep in the earth which cause the Essence pools to "bounce" back to the surface. Whatever the true cause may be, the existence of these resurfaced pools of <span id="essence">Essence</span> are always a great treasure. By now you have surely guessed that these pools of <span id="essence">Essence</span> are often called Earthnodes.</p>
<p>The <span id="essence">Fluid Essence Theory</span> further explains the basic principle behind catalyst casting. Just as the <span id="essence">Essence</span> is created and expelled by living creatures, some portions of plants and creatures retain small amounts of <span id="essence">Essence</span>. The exact reason for this <span id="essence">Essential Retention</span> is still unknown, though it is thought by many that <span id="essence">Essence</span> is retained within a creature as a portion of its soul or will. It is for this reason that catalyst casters find the <span id="essence">Essence</span> within living things to be aligned with uses more in keeping with the original creature's nature or self-perception.</p>
<p>The <span id="essence">Fluid Essence Theory</span> best explain the production and nature of ley lines and to a lesser degree earthnodes. Unfortunately, it does not explain the actual perceptions of scholars when they view the <span id="essence">Essence</span> through he use of power perception and aura spells. The <span id="essence">Radiant Essence Theory</span> more closely follows these perceptions.</p>
<p>The <span id="essence">Radiant Essence Theory</span> was formed based on actual observation of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> in motion. <span id="essence">Essence</span> seems to radiate out from living creatures. Normal creatures yield very faint, barely perceptible glows of <span id="essence">Essence</span>, whereas magical creatures and powerful spell users radiate a greater glow. According to the <span id="essence">Radiant Essence Theory</span>, all creatures radiate <span id="essence">Essence</span> as a function of living. This <span id="essence">Essence</span> "warms" the surrounding area, much like the radiant energy from the sun warms the earth.</p>
<p><span id="essence">Radiant Essence</span> theorists assume that the small amount of <span id="essence">Essence</span> produced by living creatures cannot possibly account for all of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> found in the world, especially not the ley lines or earthnodes. To explain these phenomena they suggest that the earth must be a globe with a very "hot" <span id="essence">Essence</span> center. Some suggest that the center of the earth is nearly a living creature and that it too has a soul that generates <span id="essence">Essence</span>, while others again suggest the center of the earth as the true home of the gods who radiate <span id="essence">Essence</span> of a much more powerful nature than other living creatures. Regardless, these theorists suggest that ley lines and earthnodes are simply tiny cracks in the earth's surface that allow the earth's <span id="essence">Essence</span> to shine through. The fact that earthnodes have been proven to have a limited radius in all directions limits the validity of this concept though many have attempted to reconcile these differences.</p>
<p><span id="essence">Radiant Essence Theory</span> is most often used as a model for teaching power perception and spiritual seekers of the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. <span id="essence">Fluid Essence Theory</span> is most often used as a model for magic researchers and the more analytical seekers of the <span id="essence">Essence</span>.</p>
<p>The true nature of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> cannot be captured in either of these theories. The <span id="essence">Unified Essence Theory</span> will have to await new breakthroughs in the research into earthnodes, auras, power perception, ley lines, and life itself. Some say that since the only limit to the application of <span id="essence">Essence</span> is the comprehension and creativity of the mind, that so long as new thoughts are formed the nature of <span id="essence">Essence</span> will change. Still most scholars insist that all things can be analyzed into logical patterns that can be reproduced time and time again. Once all of the applications of <span id="essence">Essence</span> have been at least theoretically mapped out, the true nature of <span id="essence">Essence</span> should be close at hand.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/2.0/SCHOOLS OF MAGIC" -->
<h1><a name="EC_2.0">2.0</a> SCHOOLS OF MAGIC</h1>
<p><span id="essence">Essence</span>, more than any other form of magic, is a magic of experimentation and intellectual curiosity. <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> is a magic of faith. <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> is a magic of self control and state of mind. <span id="essence">Essence</span> is the magic of knowledge&mdash;a knowledge achieved by many methods.</p>
<p>As <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> magic divided over time, those more analytical and scientific students studied <span id="essence">Essence</span> over the other two realms of magic. As these spell users specialized in <span id="essence">Essence</span>, they discovered five different methods for controlling it. These methods were uniquely keyed to controlling <span id="essence">Essence</span>, rather than <span id="arcane">Arcane</span>, <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>, or <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>.</p>
<p>The key to each of these techniques, or schools as they later came to be known, is the method by which the caster attunes himself and the <span id="essence">Essence</span> to a specific spell effect. Schools of magic are analogous to schools of thought and should not be confused with a university. A school of magic is a philosophy, science and framework for understanding <span id="essence">Essence</span>. A school of magic is a model that allows a student to grasp difficult concepts and to anticipate the results of experiments. A university may teach more than one school of magic, while a school of magic is not limited to a university setting.</p><p>The schools of magic reflect a division in scholarly explication of <span id="essence">Essence</span> magic. All <span id="essence">Essence</span> magic is controlled by precise words, catalysts, and movements that are harmonious or sympathetic towards a specific effect. Each school of magic focuses on one of these methods of controlling magic to the exclusion of the other methods. By learning the proper words, catalysts, and movements, an <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell user can reproduce almost any <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> effect more accurately, consistently, and with finer control than any <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> caster could dream of. Excited by the prospect of greater control and power, the original <span id="essence">Essence</span> casters happily divested themselves of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> and <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> and the subtleties they concealed.</p>
<p>The original studies were less methodical than some scholars suggest, involving intuitive leaps and many wild goose chases. Eventually these students discovered the central concepts that form the foundation of all <span id="essence">Essence</span> casting. Originally, all <span id="essence">Essence</span> casters used a hodgepodge collection of words of power, magical motions, and secret catalysts to create their spells. As <span id="essence">Essence</span> users continued to specialize, each spell caster found it easier to specialize either in languages, movements, or catalysts alone.</p>
<p>The schools of magic formed slowly as each master shared his knowledge until the basics of <span id="essence">Essence</span> casting came to be known more generally. Over time masters found it beneficial to control the distribution of magic and jealously guarded their magical knowledge. This trend continues in the existing division of spell knowledge into base lists, closed lists and open lists.</p>
<p>Eventually this created the current situation where each profession is generally limited to a single school of magic. Often many different schools of magic developed within the same region by different professions. The net result is that <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell users may know the exact same spells, but understand them and cast them in totally different fashions.</p>
<p>The five schools of magic that have developed are <a href="#EC_2.1">Herbalist</a>, <a href="#EC_2.2">Corpist</a>, <a href="#EC_2.3">Crystalist</a>, <a href="#EC_2.4">Nomenist</a>, and <a href="#EC_2.5">Somaticist</a>.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/2.1/HERBALIST" -->
<h2><a name="EC_2.1">2.1</a> HERBALIST</h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>&mdash;Casters have additional power points available from their catalysts. Casters do not have to speak or gesture to cast magic. Herbal catalysts are easy to find.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>&mdash;Caster must continually seek catalysts in order to cast their spells. Herbal catalysts are low in power.</p>
<p>Herbalists are one of three schools of magic that utilize catalysts, along with the <a href="#EC_2.2">Corpist</a> and the <a href="#EC_2.3">Crystalist</a>. Catalyst casters are practitioners of <span id="essence">Essence</span> who rely on a phenomenon known as sympathetic magic. This is spell casting that exploits the fact that certain items have a predisposition toward specific magical effects and contain some quantity of <span id="essence">Essence</span>. This provides the caster with two things that aid in spell casting: direction and power. Each different catalyst is suited for the casting of one or more varieties of spell and also provides some of the necessary power points for its casting. This kind of magic is relatively easy to use (because the catalyst has a bias toward a certain kind of effect) and drains the caster of power less rapidly (because the catalyst and it's <span id="essence">Essence</span> are consumed in the casting). There are three distinct types of catalyst caster, but each relies on this principal for their spell casting.</p>
<p>Herbalists use plants for the sympathetic magic in their spells. As a novice, the Herbalist must seek out the many herbs, seeds, and fruits required for his spells, either in a marketplace or in the wild. He must maintain this stockpile of various plants to insure that he need not ration his spells. He may find that the catalysts required for one type ofspell are easier to locate than another. This personal supply and demand may help detennine which spells the caster learns and which he casts frequently.</p>
<p>Herbalists often learn medicinal, poisonous, hallucinogenic and nutritional uses for the herbs they carry. Herbalist casters are quite resourceful with spell casting, foraging, and healing. As Herbalists gain further mastery of their botanical magic, they tend to divide into two categories. Some of them will become wanderers constantly in search of those rare plants that provide the Essence for the most powerful spells. Others will settle down to become gardeners with huge crops of plants resulting in an almost never ending supply of catalysts. Some may hire adventurers to obtain those rarest of herbs that grow in remote areas guarded by fearsome inhabitants.</p>
<p>Herbal casting is relatively simple. With his will, the caster summons the <span id="essence">Essence</span> from his surroundings. As the power builds, he directs it through the catalyst, which he must hold in his hand. The magical tendencies of the catalyst direct the flow of toward its bias. For low level spells, very little fine tuning is required; and the spell almost casts itself. With higher level spells, the caster must concentrate more to create the spell results he desires. As the spell nears completion, the caster continues to concentrate on exactly the effect he desires and the catalyst provides the rest of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> required to power the spell.</p>
<p>This kind of spell casting is especially common among more primitive cultures where guilds ofmagic are unheard of. The fact that the herbal catalyst provides direction for the spell as well as part of the power makes this method easy to learn and use. However, due to limited supply of herbs and the greater degree of control required for spells ofincreasing power, many of these primitive casters do not progress far beyond their initial level of skill.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/2.2/CORPIST" -->
<h2><a name="EC_2.2">2.2</a> CORPIST</h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>&mdash;Casters have additional power points available from their catalysts. Casters do not have to speak or gesture to cast magic. Corpus catalysts are high in power.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>&mdash;Caster must continually seek catalysts in order to cast their spells. Corpus catalysts are difficult to acquire and preserve.</p>
<p>In a great many respects, Corpists are very similar to <a href="#EC_2.1">Herbalists</a>. The caster summons the <span id="essence">Essence</span> to begin the spell, directs it through the catalyst, tunes the effects as needed, and the catalyst provides the last bit of <span id="essence">Essence</span> to complete the spell. The major difference between these two styles of casting is the source of the catalyst. Where the Herbalist obtains his magical supplies from the market or a field, the Corpist must use portions of animals, monsters, or even sentient beings. Even more gruesome is the fact that the fresher the catalyst the more useful it is. This has caused the Corpist, at least in some cultures, to be unpopular. The tales of animal and human sacrifice told around campfires and bar room tables are likely drawn from the spell casting and rituals of the Corpist.</p>
<p>This is not to say that all <span id="essence">Essence</span> casters who choose this path are evil or bloodthirsty. Many Corpists believe that no life should be taken in vain and believe in frugality. These casters obtain their catalysts from the parts left over when the hunters and butchers are done. In this way, no useful portion of an animal is wasted or left to rot in the sun. This variety of magic user is also common in warrior societies that are almost constantly at battle with other cultures or races. The Corpist can be found combing the battlefield for the fleshy loot left behind by the fighters. Many such casters do not limit their post battle collecting to the enemy. Many Corpists believe that a fallen warrior would like for his body to be used to posthumously strike back at the foe rather than lie in a mass grave and be forgotten.</p>
<p>Nearly all Corpists learn alchemy, skinning, and/or cooking. These skills assist the Corpist in preserving organic material for later catalyst use. Different cultures have different levels of ability in this respect; more civilized societies tend to use alchemical preservation methods, while less civilized cultures tend to smoke or dry out organic material. Some Corpists also specialize in hunting, surgery, or animal care in the process of stockpiling catalysts.</p>
<p>When Corpists are encountered, they can usually be identified by the vast selection of bones, skins, and jars of organs they carry with them. Alternatively, some may look like the ringmaster of a traveling circus. These casters believe that freshness is the way to power and that "on the hoof' is the easiest way to get their catalysts from place to place. Unfortunately for their companions, neither of these two varieties of Corpist is very fragrant.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/2.3/CRYSTALIST" -->
<h3><a name="EC_2.3">2.3</a> CRYSTALIST</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>&mdash;Casters have additional power points available from their catalysts. Casters do not have to speak or gesture to cast magic. Crystal catalysts are renewable.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>&mdash;Caster must continually seek/charge catalysts in order to cast their spells. Crystal catalysts require charging and are more vulnerable to theft.</p>
<p>In most respects the Crystalist performs magic identically to the other two catalyst casters. However, they differ greatly in that their catalysts are not destroyed in the process ofcasting the spell. Instead, the energy stored in the crystal matrix is discharged. A t first this would seem to give them a tremendous advantage: they need not replenish their stock of catalysts. A Crystalist does spend less time hunting for catalysts, but his ability to cast spells is limited by the amount of charges a crystal can contain. Before casting any spell, the Crystalist must spend a great deal of time and power points recharging the crystal matrices so that his very expensive catalysts aren't destroyed. With ample time to prepare, the Crystalist can meet almost any challenge, but caught unaware and low on charged crystals, he is nearly helpless.</p>
<p>Every crystal has a capacity to hold charges of <span id="essence">Essence</span> that can be used by the Crystalist for spell casting. Each charge contributes a set amount of power points towards the casting of a spell. The amount of power points contributed by each charge is based on the size of the gem. If a gem with no charges is ever used as a catalyst, then it is destroyed. <a href="#EC_2.1">Herbalists</a> and <a href="#EC_2.2">Corpists</a> are intrigued by the possibility of learning how to "charge" their own catalysts, but all attempts have so far failed. The fragile nature of these catalysts does not lend itself to such manipulation.</p>
<p>To cast his spells the Crystalist gathers his will and summons the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. This <span id="essence">Essence</span> is directed into a specific crystal where it is biased toward a certain kind of general effect. The caster molds this mana into the precise effect he desires, pushes the spell through the crystal, and creates magic. The <span id="essence">Essence</span> contained in the crystal matrix performs two functions. The first is that of cohesion. The <span id="essence">Essence</span> provides strength to hold the crystal together under the often extreme pressures of spell casting. Without the power of this <span id="essence">Essence</span>, the gem would disintegrate or explode with the casting of a spell. The other purpose of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> in the crystal matrix is to enhance the caster's own power. The caster draws on the reserves of <span id="essence">Essence</span> stored in the crystal matrix to provide part of the power for the spell. The crystal must be charged prior to casting, or the caster gains no power from the crystal and worse, the crystal will shatter.</p>
<p>Crystalists are often recognized by the expensive jewelry they wear. Many employ a veritable army of guards to dissuade the greedy. The danger of theft is doubly important to Crystalists, since the gems they carry have value beyond the monetary. More than one Crystalist has assumed the appearance of a destitute vagabond, to keep his precious catalysts safe.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/2.4/NOMENIST" -->
<h2><a name="EC_2.4">2.4</a> NOMENIST</h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>&mdash;Casters require no somatic gestures or material components to cast spells. Their spells are also cast more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>-The caster may not cast his spells if he is gagged, mute, or otherwise unable to speak. The caster must also continually seek to learn new languages to increase his understanding of the Primal Tongue.</p>
<p>Some spell casters have discovered that different words evoke different facets of the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. When the first words were spoken by sentient beings, the <span id="essence">Essence</span> was imprinted with their sounds. Thereafter, those words would resonate with the power of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> and speaking them could produce magical effects. Yet languages inevitably change over time, as civilizations rise and fall, as populations move and absorb new cultures. Some even die out completely. Thus the power of those first words, the "Primal Tongue," was diluted, the words themselves forgotten until a few scattered bits of it were rediscovered. It is these bits of the Primal Tongue, in the form of spoken words, which the Nomenist prizes and constantly seeks. To uncover these words of power, the spell caster must study the roots of languages and separate the parts of the tongue that were passed down from more ancient and magical languages.</p>
<p>The path to knowing the Primal Tongue only begins with studying various languages at the city library. The true roots of ancient language lie on the fringes of civilized lands, where cultures have changed little in hundreds of years. Isolated islands, forgotten cities deep within jungles, or deep subterranean caverns where nearly immortal dragons sleep&mdash;these are all places where keys to the Primal Tongue lies. These are the places to which the Nomenist must travel if he ever wishes to grasp even a small percent of the Primal Tongue. As he travels to these remote locations and learns the many languages he must, the student will realize the value oflearning the more rare (and more difficult) tongues. A few ranks of an ancient, long forgotten dialect can contain more of the Primal Tongue than an intricate study of every language on an entire civilized continent.</p>
<p>As the Nomenist student begins his studies, his understanding of the Primal Tongue will be nearly nonexistent. The words of power he knows will be few and relatively far removed from the language of the ancients. His spells will be simple and weak because of their inability to resonate fully with the local <span id="essence">Essence</span>. As his study of civilized language becomes more complete, not only will he gain a greater knowledge of the more ancient words in his native language(s), but his pronunciation of the magical words he knows will become better. Should the caster cease his search for new languages to learn, his ability to learn new spells from other lists won't be compromised, but his ability to learn spells of higher level will be curtailed.</p>
<p>The Primal Tongue is not a true language. A master can not teach Primal Tongue to his pupils. Primal Tongue can not be translated into any other language, because each word of Primal Tongue is unique to each individual. Primal Tongue is not just a set of ancient words, or even the first words as they are often characterized, but it is a unique pidgin language that allows the caster to communicate directly with the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. The words of Primal Tongue are unique to each spell caster. A student must study all languages in order to discover his personal version of Primal Tongue. Scholars theorize that it is not words that the Nomenist uses to control the <span id="essence">Essence</span>, but concepts. They suggest that students must learn new ways of saying a concept until they refine their understanding of that concept to a point of control.</p>
<p>This constant search for more languages of greater antiquity or drains the Nomenist physically, monetarily, and in time devoted to other pursuits. Yet, the rewards for this effort are manifold. As the caster's knowledge of the Primal Tongue continues to increase, so does his ability to cast spells of higher and higher level. Furthermore, the understanding of such a broad spectrum of languages is a reward in itself. The caster will almost al ways be the translator and possibly diplomat for any group of which he is part. He may uncover information that others cannot due to the language barrier and might even gain use ofa magical text that no one else can use. The Nomenist gains one further advantage from his study of language: speed. Because he only needs to use key words and phrases that evoke the effect that he desires, the Nomenist's incantations tend to be brief. This can be a distinct advantage when the caster needs quick magic in unfamiliar lands.</p>

<h2><a name="EC_2.5">2.5</a> SOMATICIST</h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>&mdash;Casters require no verbal or material components to cast spells. No additional skills required to develop this school of magic.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>&mdash;The caster may not cast his spells if he bound, held, or paralyzed. Their spells are difficult to record and generally require live teachers.</p>
<p>The spell caster who uses the Somaticist School calls forth and shapes the <span id="essence">Essence</span> with motions of his body. By tuning himself to the surrounding <span id="essence">Essence</span> and making specific forms and gestures the Somaticist can handle and shape <span id="essence">Essence</span> as if it were a tangible object. At its most basic level, the student is merely pushing the <span id="essence">Essence</span> around, accomplishing simple tasks by brute force. This kind of casting is neither complex nor efficient, but it does have the advantage of being easy for the novice to understand.</p>
<p>As his understanding of the ways in which one "grips" the <span id="essence">Essence</span> improves, the student learns other ways to move it. This is analogous to learning that in order to move a boulder, not only can one pick it up, but also push it, pull it, roll it, etc. This makes the caster capable of more complex and powerful spells that require less effort. As the student approaches mastery of Somaticist, he learns to form more complex shapes with the <span id="essence">Essence</span> and eventually to combine these shapes with others to perform spells that accomplish multifaceted tasks. At this level, the caster can call forth the <span id="essence">Essence</span> and roughly shape it purely by willpower. It is only for the more complicated aspects of the spell that he uses his gestures and movements, but these become critical. The forms that the caster makes must be extremely precise. Some may be almost unobservable to the casual onlooker. Once the caster has the ability to make these intricate shapes and combinations of shapes with the <span id="essence">Essence</span> he can truly boast of being a master of Somaticist.</p>
<p>Somaticists are as a rule agile and dexterous. Often they excel at dancing, juggling, acrobatics, sign language, or any other skill which requires precise or graceful movement. Somaticists do not have to speak to cast their spells, but most are taught or develop spoken mnemonic devices to aid them in remembering the moves necessary to successfully cast their spells. Those students who have long relationships with their mentors have a distinct advantage over those spell casters who go it alone early in their careers since the forms and movements required to cast all but the most basic spells are difficult to self teach. Those students who seek to learn this art from books will find that most tomes on Somaticism are very large. Because only very simple gestures can be described in words, these works can often require hundreds of pages of illustrations to convey the proper motions for one spell. A great many Essence users tend to follow this school, for although it requires many hours of tedious exercise and concentration, it is a very self-contained style of magic. The caster never need fear that by losing some magical tome or precious catalyst that his ability to cast spells could be compromised.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/2.6/CROSS-TRAINING SCHOOLS OF MAGIC" -->
<h2><a name="EC_2.6">2.6</a> CROSS-TRAINING SCHOOLS OF MAGIC</h2>
<p>While most students learn a single school of magic and build on the individual strengths and weaknesses of the one school, others seek to broaden their knowledge by developing multiple schools of magic. Students learn new spell lists by a school of magic different from his primary school with more difficulty as he not only has to learn the new material, but also to unlearn his primary school teachings. The character is subject to the strengths and weaknesses of the school of magic used to learn each individual spell list.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a student could learn a spell list by his primary school and then re-learn that list with a new school. Students who learn the breadth of a list by developing multiple schools receive the strengths and weaknesses of both schools. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">magician</a> who learns <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.4.2">Fire Law</a> as a <a href="#EC_2.5">Somaticist</a> and as a <a href="#EC_2.4">Nomenist</a> to the same level may cast the spell as a <a href="#EC_2.5">Somaticist</a> list, as a <a href="#EC_2.4">Nomenist</a> list, or as an amalgam of the two schools. As long as the caster follows the requirements of the school of magic (appropriate catalyst in hand, appropriate ranks in Primal Tongue, free hands), then the caster gains the benefits of both schools of magic.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/2.7/APPLYING THE SCHOOLS OF MAGIC" -->
<h2><a name="EC_2.7">2.7</a> APPLYING THE SCHOOLS OF MAGIC</h2>
<p>The schools of magic can be applied to a game world in several ways. They can either be academic divisions of thought, cultural divisions of thought, or professional divisions of thought. The choice of division is important for the GM to consider carefully before assigning to his world as the implications will run deep. If the GM chooses to use the schools of magic, he must determine whether he will use all of them within his world as well as whether or not he will allow <span id="essence">Essence</span> users the choice of using the <a href="5500.html">Rolemaster Standard System</a> magic rules. We suggest that the schools of magic should be used in place ofthe standard rules as they provide a new source for creative roleplaying and further identifying essence casters from spell casters of other realms.</p>
<p>If the GM chooses to use the schools of magic as a division of academic thought, then in any given society it will be normal for there to be multiple schools of magic being taught or practiced. These varying schools of magic will not be limited by professional restrictions. Some <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">magicians</a> will be <a href="#EC_2.3">Crystalists</a>, some will be <a href="#EC_2.4">Nomenists</a>, etc. Schools of magic in this type of society will often rival one another for political clout or popular opinion. Each school will protest that the other school is limited in some way, but normally these divisions will be of moderate vehemency fi more of a professional rivalry then anything else.</p>
<p>The schools of magic can also be used to accentuate cultural differences and approaches to magic. In some primitive lands <a href="#EC_2.2">Corpists</a> and <a href="#EC_2.1">Herbalists</a> abound. The desert nomads may learn magic as <a href="#EC_2.4">Nomenists</a>, learning new languages as trade caravans pass through their land. The underground cultures may specialize in <a href="#EC_2.3">Crystalist</a> magic. The eastern empire may specialize in martial arts and <a href="#EC_2.5">Somaticism</a>. If this system ofdivision is used, new cultures will often disdain the magic of other cultures as being too primitive, or too barbaric, or too esoteric. Observers of spell casting from a different school of magic will often mistrust the control or power of such magic, which often leads to fear.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the schools of magic may be used to further isolate profession from profession. All <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Magicians</a> in the known world are <a href="#EC_2.3">Crystalists</a>, all <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mana_Molder">Mana Molders</a> are <a href="#EC_2.2">Corpists</a>, and all <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Runemage">Runemages</a> are <a href="#EC_2.4">Nomenists</a>. In such a world the professional base lists are even more removed from other professions to learn as they require an entire different approach to understand. Professions may also have access to various closed and open lists limited by their inability to understand the school of magic of that individual list.</p>
<p>Finally, a GM may choose to have only one school of magic work for his particular world. Anyone school of magic could be used as the sole manner of practicing magic in a given world. If the GM chooses such a route, then the world will still have a distinct magic style that is unique to <span id="essence">Essence</span>. The whole purpose of the schools of magic is to distinguish <span id="essence">Essence</span> magic from other realms and to increase the roleplaying potential of <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell users.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/3.0/RITUAL MAGIC" -->
<h1><a name="EC_3.0">3.0</a> RITUAL MAGIC</h1>
<p>Before the students of <span id="essence">Essence</span> designed spell lists and before the formation of the Schools of Magic, the students of <span id="essence">Essence</span> learned to control the <span id="essence">Essence</span> through slow and painstaking rituals. Rituals were a methodical approach to learning how to control <span id="essence">Essence</span>, since it is slower and allows for more experimentation in spell effects. Before any spell list was designed, each and every spell effect was explored through the process of magic rituals.</p>
<p>Magic rituals are not spells. A ritual is not a list of commands that must be followed to produce a result&mdash;though this can be done, it is the lowest form of magic ritual casting. A student of magic rituals learns a number of methods or tools with which to slowly craft <span id="essence">Essence</span> into a spell effect. It takes longer than normal spell casting, but magic rituals allow a caster to create any number of effects. Instead of a rote for casting a firebolt, a magic ritualist learns methods of shaping the essence into various fire effects, which can include firebolts, fire walls, boiling liquids, or heating up dinner.</p>
<p>Once the early students of <span id="essence">Essence</span> learned the methods that most easily controlled the <span id="essence">Essence</span>, they began forming the spell lists. At first the spell lists were considered a crutch for those with poor control. Some students scoffed at the great limitations they imposed on the spell caster. As newer students began pursuing the studies of <span id="essence">Essence</span>, a great many found the quickly learned and quickly cast spell lists a great tool. With spell lists students could rival their masters in a short time, by virtue of the speed of their casting rather than their knowledge or artistic control of the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. It did not take long for the spell lists to supplant the use of ritual magic. Today only the true scholars and artistic students of <span id="essence">Essence</span> are drawn to ritual magic for the great flexibility it gives.</p>
<p>In contrast to the majority of the scholarly crowd, there are a number of more primitive cultures that still foster ritual magic as the primary form of <span id="essence">Essence</span> casting. These cultures often hold to the original tradition of the rituals with greater tenacity, perhaps due to the nature of oral tradition. Oral tradition leads itself well to the teaching of methods and concepts, whereas oral tradition often looses subtle nuances and details that are more necessary for spell lists than magic rituals.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/4.0/LEARNING SPELL LISTS" -->
<h1><a name="EC_4.0">4.0</a> LEARNING SPELL LISTS</h1>
<p>As masters of the various schools of magic taught more students, they began to develop patterns in the way they taught. It has been said that there are as many ways to teach as there are students. While this may be true, certain methods were obviously better adapted to conveying magical knowledge. Magic required a very intensive level of study of complex materials. The base ideas behind a spell list were not intuitive. This knowledge had to come from somewhere and did not simply "occur" to the students. This means that an untrained novice had to seek instruction from some source outside himself. These outside sources were not always easy to come by. Such magic knowledge may have been heavily guarded, available only to those of certain social status, race, guild affiliation, etc. Those who truly desired to become proficient in the magical arts often had to travel to far away lands or seek out rogue spell users who would teach them.</p>
<p>This can still be seen in societies where the secrets of magic are held closely by a few. Those who are among these privileged few enjoy a greater status among those who are unable or untrained to cast spells. This kind of society does leave room for those who try to learn magic unsanctioned by the established guilds. These casters have to learn from rebel mentors or stolen texts and every new secret is precious to them. These "rogue casters" are certainly hunted by the magical guilds and in some cases are enemies of the state.</p>
<p>In societies where magic ability is cultivated in a broader spectrum of the population, things are more egalitarian. Those who wish to learn the ways of magic and have genuine talent can usually find someplace to acquire this knowledge. Spell casters in these societies are regarded with less wonder, but also less fear and hatred. Ideas are more freely exchanged, but guild rivalries can still be serious and violent.</p>
<p>Regardless of how free a society is about providing training for its potential spell casters, the methods by which these students learn fall into a few distinct categories: books, mentors, guilds, universities, and self teaching.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/4.1/BOOKS" -->
<h2><a name="EC_4.1">4.1</a> BOOKS</h2>
<p>Books are a good medium for recording information for one's own use. When they are used to teach others, they have strengths and limitations that human teachers do not. Once written, they can be used by others, copied and distributed widely. If means of producing multiple copies (printing presses, copying spells, industrious monks, etc.) of a book are available, information can be brought to a great many people who needn't have ever met the author. The information contained therein is consistently broadcast to a large audience, all of whom are getting more or less the same message. This can also be considered a drawback, since the author loses control of who gains access to the information. Where spells or entire spell lists are concerned this can be especially dangerous. Not only might spells that are dangerous be learned by anyone who has access to the book, but enemies of the author can study his spells to search for weaknesses. Another drawback is lack of correct interpretation. The author might be a brilliant spell caster, but ifhe hasn't conveyed all the subtle nuances of his art in the book, the student may not get much benefit from studying it. The single greatest advantage of books as a form of spell learning, however, is portability. It is nearly impossible to be in two places at once. Books make it possible for a student to travel far from his master and still continue his education.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of books from which a student can learn spells, though some are more useful than others. The most common, but least useful variety to most casters, are the lore books. Lore books contain information that may pertain to magic in some fashion, but they don't have the information by themselves to allow learning of the spell list. They are most useful for those who have another means of learning the spells already and want supplemental information, or for those who are conducting in depth spell research. The second type of book useful for learning spells is the magical tome. These books are extremely valuable to a spell caster because they unlock enough of the secrets of a spell list to allow the caster to learn it without help from a mentor or teacher. For this reason, many mentors only allow their students to study such books under strict supervision. If too many of them get out, the results could be disastrous to the teaching community. The last and most valuable of the magical books is the Spell book. These are extremely powerful works of magic. Not only do they allow the reader to learn the spells they contain, but those spells may be cast directly out of the book. Of course, this deletes the spell from the book and degrades the book as a whole, but the capability is there.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/4.2/MENTORS" -->
<h2><a name="EC_4.2">4.2</a> MENTORS</h2>
<p>Mentors are probably the most common source for spell list teaching in most societies. They are those users of magic who have decided for some reason (usually a fee or servitude) to pass their knowledge on to less experienced casters. The availability of a mentor is largely based on the ability ofthe students. Ifthere are few mentors, only those students with the most ability (and money) will be trained in the use of magic. If there are a large number of mentors, the students can pick the mentors who are the best teachers (or at least the most famous). The primary thing that separates mentors from teachers is the length of the relationship with the student. When a student or apprentice signs on with a mentor, it is usually with the understanding that the apprentice will remain until the mentor deems him ready to make his own way as a mage. Sometimes, the relationship will end before this time, usually because the student does not have what it takes to be a successful caster.</p><p>The mentor or master may place harsh demands upon the apprentice, often for the students own good. The manipulation of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> is a dangerous and exacting practice. An apprentice can be a danger to himself and others if not instilled with a proper discipline and respect for this power. The way that mentors often engender these qualities in their students is through hard work and menial labor. These tasks can have a broader application to the use ofmagic, but this is almost never apparent to the apprentice at the time.</p>
<p>The apprentice does not have many rights in this relationship, but he does have a few. Mentors are usually required to house and feed the apprentice. Any materials required for the apprentice to learn his spells must be provided by the mentor (books, catalysts, etc.). And the apprentice is entitled to the protection of the mentor while in his service. Nothing scares off future apprentices than having a few of them cut to pieces while in your service.</p>
<p>The exact nature of the relationship between apprentice and mentor is so varied that it cannot be generalized. Some mentors will be kindly elders who dote on their students. Others will be miserly men who hope to squeeze as much work from a student as possible and teach little in exchange. Most will fall in between these two extremes.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/4.3/GUILDS" -->
<h2><a name="EC_4.3">4.3</a> GUILDS</h2>
<p>Guilds are the next logical step forward from the mentors. They may be viewed as a group of mentors who live and/or work together. This is a bit of an oversimplification, since often guilds have a purpose larger than the teaching of students. The guild may have a political agenda or may simply be trying to make money. In any event, at some point it becomes necessary for such a guild to take on new members. The most logical way to do this is by training apprentices. This assures that the member will know exactly what the existing members want him to know. A guild-trained member will be more loyal to the guild than a member trained somewhere else.</p>
<p>The benefits of guild training are not all to the guild, however. The apprentice can study under a variety of different mentors who use magic in different ways. Thus the apprentice avoids becoming a "carbon copy" of his mentor. Guild training may also offer social benefits. Being part of a certain magical guild may hold a degree of honor or prestige in the community. Having a place to return to in order to receive further training fi often free fi is another benefit. Finally, if a guild member is in trouble of some kind, he may call upon other members for assistance.</p>
<p>A guild may consist of a highly organized group of <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Wizard">Wizards</a>, who have associated guilds in every major city in an empire or kingdom. Alternatively, a simple group of shamans or witches can be considered a guild. The only requirement is that the group have some kind of organization, and at least some common goals.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/4.4/UNIVERSITIES" -->
<h2><a name="EC_4.4">4.4</a> UNIVERSITIES</h2>
<p>Universities are similar to guilds in many ways. They generally consist ofseveral users ofmagic who live and/or work in the same area. They differ from guilds in their purpose. While the purpose ofa guild can be anything from taking control of a kingdom to keeping the guild secret, the primary goal of a university is to educate. Many times this is different from the way a mentor or guild teaches. Mentors and guilds teach apprentices in order to gain service or loyalty from them. Universities usually teach students for a fee or as part of a program initiated by the society or government.</p>
<p>The university system can be of great benefit to the student as well as the institution. The student benefits because universities may accept admission of a student from a different social status or background than a guild might. Since the student is usually paying to attend, the university can be relatively assured that the student is trying his best. Also, if there are a great many applicants, the university can be choosy about which ones get accepted, thereby assuring a higher quality of students, and therefore graduates.</p>
<p>A fairly high degree of civilization is required to support a university. Such places would be prizes enemy armies would attempt to exploit. Such a rich depository of knowledge and magic requires a stable kingdom or empire to make it safe enough to exist. The presence of a university implies a great freedom of knowledge that is typically not present in most societies. Remember that the exchange of knowledge about such things as base lists is damaging to the profession as a whole.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/4.5/SELF TEACHING" -->
<h2><a name="EC_4.5">4.5</a> SELF TEACHING</h2>
<p>One seldom used method of magical study that is seldom used is self teaching-taking a base of knowledge and building upon it by experimentation and trial and error. An unproductive method, it takes more time and energy than any of the others. However, it may be the only option open to a caster who's options for receiving magical instruction are limited by lack of teachers, laws forbidding magic, rigid social hierarchies, religious biases, or other factors. Also, self teaching can serve as an interim method for a caster who is unable to reach his normal source of information and instruction.</p>
<p>A self teaching student can not begin with nothing. He must have at least rudimentary knowledge of the basic concepts he is working with and a larger goal he is working towards. At least some formal instruction (by one of the methods mentioned above) must have taken place prior to the attempt to teach oneself.</p>
<p>From this base of knowledge, the caster can slowly build a better understanding of magic principals. The spells along the path of study will become apparent. This laborious process may require many hours of experimentation, often with no results. The researcher may follow leads down paths that only confuse him.</p>
<p>However, some of the greatest discoveries in magic have been by those who taught themselves. Such leaps of logic are often impossible in the closely confined realm of the classroom where students are taught to always think in the same, but not necessarily the best, ways. But at its root Essence spell casting is a science, and as with all sciences, it is far easier to build upon the knowledge ofothers than to begin from scratch.</p>

<p><em>Essence Companion</em> also provides for a new set of spell lists called training package spell lists. Training package spell lists are a new category of spell lists within the <em>RMSS</em>. All training package spell lists are classified as Restricted skills unless the character is currently associated with the training package that awards the spell list. Note that "associated with" has no firm definition. The GM should judge whether it is reasonable for the character to still have normal access to the spells or not. As an example, suppose a character was a stone mason and had received the Stone Crafting spell list as a vocational skill. If that character decided to go travelling on an adventure, he would probably no longer have access to learning new spells on that list (and the skill shifts to a Restricted classification).</p>
<p>All training package spell lists are part of the Spell Group (and will receive any bonuses appropriate to that group).

<p><a name="Symbol_Lore"></a><strong>Symbol Lore</strong>&mdash;Required for drawing appropriate symbols for use with the <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_2.2.10">Symbolic Ways</a> spell list. Each rank of Symbol Lore allows the character to draw a symbol that can be used with the same rank spell from <a href="../en.lproj/spells.htm;#SL_2.2.10">Symbolic Ways</a>. This skill also gives the caster a chance to decipher what spell is imbedded in a symbol, and, if the symbol is not constant, what parameters can set is off.</p>
<p><a name="Warding_Lore"></a><strong>Warding Lore</strong>&mdash;Required for drawing appropriate wards for use with the <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#EC_14.4.6">Warding Ways</a> spell list. Each rank of Warding Lore allows the character to draw a ward that can be used with the same rank spell from <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#EC_14.4.6">Warding Ways</a>. This skill also gives the caster a chance to decipher what spell is imbedded in a ward and possibly what parameters can set it off.</p>

<p><a name="Caving"></a><strong>Caving</strong>&mdash;This skill also is used as a bonus for finding crystals within a cave or cavern.</p>
<p><a name="Foraging"></a><strong>Foraging</strong>&mdash;The GM should allow a character with at least 1 rank of this skill (Catalyst Foraging-Herbal, or Catalyst Foraging-Corpus) the ability to gather Level 0 and Level 1 Catalysts while traveling. The exact number of doses a character can acquire will depend on the density of the catalyst and the difficulty involved in procuring the catalyst.</p>

<p><a name="Power_Perception"></a><strong>Power Perception</strong>&mdash;The ability to perceive magic in an active or donnant state is a difficult skill to master, which is why this skill is generally restricted. Once mastered, power perception is still a difficult skill requiring a great deal of concentration and it only reveals the presence of magic and the realm, never any details on the nature or type of magic present. In order to use this skill, a character must concentrate for a full minute in order to orient on the magic around him. The following modifiers apply to the skill power perception.</p>
<p><a name="Read_Runes"></a><strong>Read Runes</strong>&mdash;In addition to allowing the caster to use and decipher runes, this skill is required for inscribing appropriate runes in conjunction with <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.1.8">Rune Mastery</a> and Inscriptions spell lists. Each rank of Read Runes allows the character the ability to inscribe an equivalent level spell into a rune.</p>

<p><a name="Magic_Ritual"></a><strong>Magic Ritual</strong>&mdash;In depth rules on this skill can be found later in this book in the section on <a href="#EC_9.0">Magic Rituals</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Spell_Mastery"></a><strong>Spell Mastery</strong>&mdash;GM may decide to allow a character to develop skill in spell mastery based on a category of magic as opposed to a specific list. This more accurately reflects the character's understanding of a particular type of magic. Spell mastery by category also allows the use of this skill in regards to spells or rituals.</p>

<p><a name="Anthropology"></a><strong>Anthropology</strong>&mdash;Simple observation of a culture and a successful anthropology roll allows a character to learn about a culture. Each level a character can learn 1 extra rank in a given language, than the source would allow. For example, if a book was written at rank 5, the character could learn the language up to rank 6.</p>
<p><a name="Alchemy"></a><strong>Alchemy</strong>&mdash;Alchemy can also be used to preserve organic material such as wood, paper, flesh, leather, vegetation, organs, etc. A character may store organic matter in a fluid solution, a desiccated state, through infusions of oils or wax, or other appropriate measures. If successful, the organic material in question will not decay, unless conditions change (e.g., it gets wet, insects attack it, it molds, the seal is broken, etc.).</p>
<p>Proper preservative solutions can either be purchased orcreated with appropriate herbs. The GM should modify these attempts by their appropriateness. Partial successes and near successes will delay the decaying process, but will not prevent it.</p>
<p>The difficulty of preserving an organic material depends on the type of material.</p>

<p><a name="Preparing Herbs"></a><strong>Preparing Herbs</strong>&mdash;Herbs can be prepared in many ways. Some of the various methods and their effects are described below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Infusions</strong>&mdash;An infusion is brewing the catalyst into a tea. This process imparts the herbal properties to the water. Use 1 or 2 teaspoons of catalyst to a cup of water for best effect. Infusions may be used medicinally or as a catalyst (though the infusion process does not modify the catalyst for purposes of spell casting). Easy maneuver roll.</p>
<p><strong>Decoctions</strong>&mdash;The exact same thing as an infusion, but generally used on roots and tougher catalysts. Decoctions are made by simmering the same proportions in a pan. Light maneuver roll.</p>
<p><strong>Tinctures</strong>&mdash;Tinctures are formed by soaking 8 oz of an herb (4 oz if dried) in a pint of alcohol (60% proof or better). Tinctures should be kept out of sunlight and shaken often during the 2 weeks following their creation. After 2 weeks, the tincture can be stored in small, colored bottles, which should be sealed with wax until needed. Tinctures preserve herbs very well and increase the potency of any herbal catalyst by 1 level (a level 1 herb is now a level 2 herb, and so forth). The number of doses ofcatalyst started with do not change through the tincture process. For healing purposes this should increase the medicinal power ofthe herbs (GM discretion). Very hard maneuver roll.</p>
<p><strong>Liniments</strong>&mdash;The same as a tincture, but used for external rubs and washes. Hard maneuver roll.</p>
<p><strong>Poultices</strong>&mdash;Made to assist in first aid, poultices are made with a clean cloth and the selected herbs, often combined with flour to mix it all together. Boiled water is poured over the cloth to moisten the collection. The cloth is then bandaged over the wound. Poultices with appropriate herbs (GM discretion) should add a bonus to first aid ranging from +5 to +35. Medium maneuver roll.</p></blockquote>

<p>This section contains details on the new skills introduced in this book.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_5.4.3.0.1">5.4.3.0.1</a> <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Influence">Influence</a> Skill Category</h5>
<p><a name="Teaching"></a><strong>Teaching</strong>&mdash;A character with teaching has a knack for explaining difficult concepts in an understandable way. This skill should be used whenever the character wishes to convey a concept, idea, theory, or plan that could otherwise confuse the target. In general, this gives a bonus for the amount of material successfully taught to a target. Bonuses or penalties may be used as modifiers depending upon language barriers, cultural or racial differences, intelligence of student, complexity of material, distractions, etc. This skill must be used any time a character wishes to impart specific knowledge to another. This skill also allows a target to learn taught material faster than normally would be allowed.</p>

<p><a name="Glyph_Lore"></a><strong>Glyph Lore</strong>&mdash;Required for drawing appropriate glyphs for use with the Glyphs spell list. Each rank of Glyph Lore allows the character to draw a glyph that can be used with the same rank spell from Glyphs. This skill also gives the caster a chance to decipher what spell a specific glyph is designed to hold and the general parameters of the spell.</p>

<p><a name="Familiar_Mastery"></a><strong>Familiar Mastery</strong>&mdash;This skill is used by a spell user to train his familiar. This skill must be developed separately for each specific familiar that a spell user has (which means this skill cannot be gained until the character actually has a familiar to work with). For every rank developed in this skill, the character may choose to make a static maneuver to see if his familiar has gained a level (see the definition of a familiar's level in <a href="#EC_10.0">Section 10.0</a>). If the statis maneuver is successful, the familiar has gained a level. If the character has more than one rank in this skill when he gains a familiar, he may make one static maneuver for each rank he has in this skill. However, each static maneuver requires that the character spend at least one week working closely with the familiar at least 4 hours a day.</p>
<p>Note that if the static maneuver(s) is unsuccessful, another static maneuver may not be made until the character gains another rank in this skill. This only applies after one static maneuver is made for each rank the character has in this skill.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_5.4.3.0.5">5.4.3.0.5</a> <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Power_Manipulation">Power Manipulation</a> Skill Category</h5>
<p><a name="Summoning"></a><strong>Summoning</strong>&mdash;This skill allows a caster to specify an exact creature to be summoned with a summoning spell. This allows the caster to summon a horse as opposed to a four legged hooved animal. A failure indicates the caster summons a generic creature of the type specified. Absolute failure indicates a random summoning (GM's choice). If the caster gets an absolute success, then he may specify a specific creature that he knows by name. The following modifiers apply.</p>
<p><a name="Spell_Artistry"></a><strong>Spell Artistry</strong>&mdash;This skill is primarily used by illusionists to create more vivid illusions with greater detail and similarity to real life. Spell Artistry allows an illusionist to mimic specific individuals down to minute details or to make scenes blend flawlessly with the surrounding environment. A secondary use o f this skill is to allow all spells to have adjustable visual effects upon casting. The actual parameters of a spell cannot be changed, but the basic appearance can be modified in an artistic or unique way. For example, a fire bolt could sprout wings and a fiery dragon's head as it flies at its target. The spell will do no extra damage and have no additional effect but to increase the style of the casting to impress and frighten viewers.</p>
<p><a name="Spell_Trickery"></a><strong>Spell Trickery</strong>&mdash;Spell trickery is the ability to prepare and cast spells unobtrusively. This covers all secretive casting, from casting from a hiding place to casting on someone with whom you are conversing. The total skill roll minus 100 is the penalty applied to a target's chance of observing the spell casting attempt.</p>
<p><a name="Targeting"></a><strong>Targeting</strong>&mdash;This skill is used to determine how accurately a caster places a non-attack spell. Targeting applies to the accurate placement of walls, center points of a radius effect, as well as for striking a correct target in a crowded situation. The GM should modify the roll based on the difficulty of the placement as well as the stress of the casting situation along the following guidelines:</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/6.0/THE SCHOOLS OF MAGIC" -->
<h1><a name="EC_6.0">6.0</a> THE SCHOOLS OF MAGIC</h1>
<p>One of the methods GMs may add depth to the magic systems in their worlds is to vary the means by which users of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> learn and cast spells. Anyone who has been to school can attest to the fact that different teachers use different methods to communicate knowledge to their students. It is equally true that some students learn more from one teaching method than from another. It would therefore be simplistic to assume that all <span id="essence">Essence</span> users, regardless of background, culture, or personal style, learn to cast spells in exactly the same way. The various methods described below expand on how <span id="essence">Essence</span> is harnessed and molded. Some or all of these methods may be appropriate for your campaign. The schools ofmagic require a bit more work for both GM and players in order to use them effectively and preserve game balance. The GM may decide that only characters or NPCs of certain cultures, guilds, races, or geographical areas will have access to certain methods. He may decide to include only some of them to start and introduce others later on. These additions to the rules of <span id="essence">Essence</span> casting are optional; the other sections in this book do not require their use.</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ifa GM feels that these new schools of magic are too powerful, then we suggest that he require any spell user who chooses a school of magic (other than somaticist, which is essentially the spell user from the <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>) to make a spell casting maneuverfor all spells. This will more than double the chances of a spellfailure for these spell casters, thereby restricting power levels gained by essence users.</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/6.1/CATALYST CASTING" -->
<h2><a name="EC_6.1">6.1</a> CATALYST CASTING</h2>
<p>The three sub groups of catalyst casting are: <a href="#EC_6.2">Herbalist</a>, <a href="#EC_6.3">Corpist</a>, and <a href="#EC_6.4">Crystalist</a>. All catalyst casting is based on the premise that all things are imbued with some amount of <span id="essence">Essence</span>. In order to cast spells, the mage must know how to access this <span id="essence">Essence</span> as well as the "flavor" of this <span id="essence">Essence</span>. Whenever <span id="essence">Essence</span> becomes trapped within an item it begins to take on some of the properties of that item. This <span id="essence">Essence</span> is more inclined to perform effects related to the properties of the item. For example, <span id="essence">Essence</span> trapped within a water elemental is more inclined to cast magic pertaining to water.</p>
<p>We have divided all of the existing <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell lists into categories based on their general nature (See the Spell Category Chart below). Every catalyst is linked to one of these categories. In order for a catalyst caster to cast any spell, he must have a catalyst keyed to the appropriate spell category.</p>
<p>The benefits of each type of catalyst casting will be explained below, but the major benefit of all catalyst casting is that the catalyst contributes power points to the casting of the spell.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/6.2/HERBALIST" -->
<p>Herbalists have studied the fruitful field of spell casting through the understanding of <span id="essence">Essence</span> in vegetable matter. Herbalists are often accomplished horticulturists or botanists, but they should never be confused with animists. The Herbalist is not in tune with nature like the animist is; they see the natural world through more analytical eyes. A Herbalist walking through the woods may enjoy the beauty of the scene, but he is more likely to be cataloging plants and herbs than experiencing any kind of transcendent emotion. The Herbalist must spend time and/or money gathering herbal catalysts. Herbalists can always find low level catalysts growing all over the place; high level catalysts are rare and difficult to find.</p>
<p>Herbalists generally learn how to prepare herbs for catalysts as well as healing herbs. It is rare for an Herbalist to go far without a number of prepared liniments, tonics, and other brewed preparations that can be used for spell casting, healing, or other general effects as outlined under the Herbal Catalyst section.</p>
<p>Like all catalyst casters, in order to cast any spell the Herbalist must have a catalyst associated with the spell category from which his spell comes. This catalyst must be in the caster's hand the round the spell is cast. The cast under normal <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a> rules, except that contributes its "Level" in power points to the casting of the spell. The caster must always provide at least 1 PP for the casting of each spell, regardless of the level of the spell being cast. Any power points contributed by the catalyst in excess of those required for the spell may grant a +1 per power point bonus to the Spell Casting Static Maneuver roll. Each dose of an herbal catalyst can only be used once; it is utterly consumed by the casting of the spell.</p>
<p>Only one catalyst may be used per spell.</p>
<p>As a side note, most Herbalists follow the following guidelines in collecting herbs, as do most collectors of magical herbs. These guidelines are not enforced, but are considered standard practice. Leaves and stems are generally collected after the plant blooms. Roots and bark are collected in the spring or fall. Herbs are better if they are collected early in the morning before the sun diminishes the volatile oils in the herbs. Finally, never take more than you need, which translates into take lout ofevery 10 herbs you find. By taking only 10 percent the herbalist insures a continued supply of the herb as well as leaving some for other spell casters. In very civilized lands there may be very little wild herb growing, but in campaigns where wild herbs are more common, Herbalists, for the most part, have learned to respect the power of nature and do not destroy herb populations unnecessarily.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 1</strong> Bron the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Magician</a> wishes to cast the 1st level <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.4.5">Water Law</a> spell, <em>Condensation</em>. Therefore, Bron will need a catalyst from the Water category. Luckily he has some aloe sap in his belt pouch. On the first round of his preparation, he uses 90% of his activity to prepare the spell and 10% to reach for his aloe sap. The second round, he again prepares the spell as a 90% activity and finishes getting the sap (since this is a 20% activity, this will complete that action). On the third round, Bron casts the spell. The aloe sap contributes 0 PP to the spell, but regardless the caster must always spend at least one PP of his own, so Bron spends 1 PP. Bron is glad that aloe sap is cheap stuff.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 2</strong> Now Bron wants to cast <em>Water Bolt I</em> (a 4<sup>th</sup> level <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#EC_3.4.5">Water Law</a> spell). He produces a mistletoe twig which is a level 2 water effect. He prepares and casts the spell just as he did with the <em>Condensation</em> spell, only this time, the power point contributed by the aloe sap is helpful. He spends 2 PP, the sap contributes 2 PP, and the spell is cast.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 3</strong> Now Bron wishes to cast the 5<sup>th</sup> level <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#EC_3.4.2">Fire Law</a> spell, <em>Heat Solid</em>. <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#EC_3.4.2">Fire Law</a> requires Light effect catalysts and, consulting his catalyst inventory, Bron sees that he has a few henbane seeds. He prepares the spell normally and casts. The henbane seed contributes 2 PP, so Bron only has to spend 3 PP to cast a 5<sup>th</sup> level spell!</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 4</strong> Its getting near supper time, and Bron wants some soup. He decides to cast <em>Boil Liquid</em> (1<sup>st</sup> level <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#EC_3.4.2">Fire Law</a> spell). He consults his catalyst inventory and the only catalyst he has with the Light effect is another henbane seed. He prepares and casts the spell. This time he contributes 1 PP (since he must) and the 2 PP added by the henbane seed are wasted. If Bron had to roll on the Static Maneuver Casting Chart, the extra 2 PP would give him a +2 to his roll.</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/6.3/CORPIST" -->
<h2><a name="EC_6.3">6.3</a> CORPIST</h2>
<p>Corpists are very similar to <a href="#EC_6.2">Herbalists</a>. The primary difference between them is their catalyst source: animal matter instead of vegetable matter. Corpist catalysts provide power points equal to their level for the caster to use and are limited to casting spells from a specific category.</p>
<p>Corpists may be zoologists, animal keepers, hunters, surgeons, or herders. Corpists do not have a special affinity with animals. In fact, many are quite sadistic in their treatment of animals, seeing them simply as a walking power source. This is not always the case, and there can be plenty of well meaning Corpists. A Corpist must spend time and/or money gathering corpus catalysts. Corpists can easily find low level catalysts in most any environment, though magical creatures have the most powerful and useful parts. Corpists are often ardent adventurers in pursuit of newer and more powerful catalysts.</p>
<p>Corpists often study the art of alchemy, to learn better methods of preserving organic matter and distilling the essence of a corpus catalyst into philters or charms. While not all Corpists take the time to learn these arts, the ones who do are much more welcome in civilized company, where the smell of rotting flesh is rarely tolerated or approved.</p>
<p>Like all catalyst casters, in order to cast any spell the Corpist must have a catalyst associated with the spell category from which his spell comes. This catalyst must be in the caster's hand the round the spell is cast. The spell is then cast under normal <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a> rules, except that the catalyst contributes its "Level" in power points to the casting of the spell. The caster must always provide at least 1 PP for the casting of each spell, regardless of the level of the spell being cast. Any power points contributed by the catalyst in excess of those required for the spell may grant a +1 per power point bonus to the Spell Casting Static Maneuver Chart. Each dose of a corpus catalyst can only be used once; it is utterly consumed by the casting of the spell. Only one catalyst may be used for one spell.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 1</strong> Dini the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Dabbler">Dabbler</a> is suddenly attacked by a couple of Gratar. She decides she would like to cast the 2<sup>nd</sup> level <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.5.4">Movement Mastery</a> Spell, <em>Longjump</em> (a means of escape she thinks will be especially insulting to the Gratar). This is an instantaneous spell, and she decides not to take the time to fetch a catalyst from her backpack. She must use something, however, and decides to sacrifice a beltpouch made of deer hide. She places her hand on the unsuspecting belt pouch. The deer hide is Level 0 and therefore contributes no PP. Since Dini must make up the difference, she contributes 1 PP. The spell is cast and Dini goes bouncing away from the hapless Gratar.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 2</strong> Dini unfortunately bounces right up to a sleeping Lynx. She quickly decides to begin preparing <em>Sleep III</em> (1<sup>st</sup> level <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.5.2">Influences</a> spell). For this spell, she needs a Charm category catalyst. Luckily she has one in herbeltpouch. She reaches through the handy hole made by the <em>Longjump</em> spell and breathes a sigh of relief that the oyster shell in there didn't fall out. The next round as the Lynx prepares to leap upon her, Dini casts the spell with no preparation. This time, the oyster shell provides 1 PP and Dini supplies 1 PP (since she must spend at least 1 PP for every spell) Jora total of 2 PP. More than enough for a first level spell and the extra 1 PP provide her with a +1 to her SCSM roll. She makes her spell casting static maneuver (barely) and casts the spell. Too bad the Lynx made his RR.</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/6.4/CRYSTALIST" -->
<h2><a name="EC_6.4">6.4</a> CRYSTALIST</h2>
<p>In many ways the Crystalist are the most highly sought after of the catalyst casters, as they always travel with gems and jewelry. Crystalists store power inside of natural crystals and later access this power to cast magic. Every crystal is naturally attuned to one of the spell categories, so any power stored within these crystals becomes biased towards that category. A Crystalist uses gems and crystals not only as batteries for storing <span id="essence">Essence</span>, but also for biasing the <span id="essence">Essence</span> towards the casting of a specific spell category.</p>
<p>Some Crystalists hide their precious gems, while others wear and carry their gems as a badge and warning to all. Regardless of their disposition, Crystalists are often the most suspicious and greedy of the various catalyst casters, because even non-spell users want their catalysts.</p>
<p>Crystalists are unique among catalyst casters for their catalysts are not destroyed in the process of casting spells; instead, their matrices are drained of power. When this Essence is drained too low, the caster must replenish it through the use of spells. If the caster ever drains a crystal of all of its <span id="essence">Essence</span>, it becomes "dead" and can never be charged or used as a catalyst again.</p>
<p>Because ofthe inorganic nature of crystals, the Crystalist must use spells to tap this power. Thus, Crystalism is the only school of magic that requires the student to acquire the associated training package.</p>
<p>When a Crystalist casts a spell, he must be holding the crystal he intends to use as a catalyst by the round he wishes to cast the spell. The crystal must be from the appropriate category for the spell he wants to cast. The caster must contribute at least one of his own power points and one of the charges stored in the crystal. In some cultures and guilds, these charges have come to be known as "facets," but they should not be confused with the physical facets on the surface of the gem. Each time a gem is used as a catalyst, one charge is expended and charge contributes a set number of power points based on the size and quality of the gem. No more than one charge can be used from the gem per spell cast. The following chart summarizes the power points contributed by the stones of various size and power.</p>
<p>To put the number of carats in perspective, most of the crystals on the Master Crystal Catalyst Chart average 12-15 carats per cubic cm. If the GM wants more exact figures, most are available in the <a href="5601.html">Treasure Companion</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it may be noted that the list of crystal catalysts included later in this book include a number of catalysts that are not technically crystal. These catalysts include a diverse grouping such as flint, pearl, fossil, and petrified wood. While these substances are not exactly crystals, they have been found to operate on the same principles as crystals. One theory is that most of these substances were created slowly and with enough mineral content to trap <span id="essence">Essence</span> in much the same way that growing crystals trap the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. Others point out that these items may be more appropriate to the realm of herbal or corpus casters and that apparently the methods of storing <span id="essence">Essence</span> in crystals may also work with organic substances of sufficient strength to withstand the rigors of power storage. The corollary to this theory is that crystals could be used as disposable power sources. Those less concerned with the conservation of wealth have at times sought quick power through such attempted manipulations of the <span id="essence">Essence</span>.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 1</strong> Brother Opal wishes to cast the 4<sup>th</sup> level <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.6.2">Body Renewal</a> spell, <em>Pain Relief I</em>. He has a tiny opal (his namesake) with 4 charges. Because it is a tiny-rare catalyst, the opal contributes 3 PP to the spell. Opal contributes one of his own PP and this is enough to cast the spell. The tiny opal now has 3 charges.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 2</strong> Now Opal wishes to cast the 2<sup>nd</sup> level <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.6.3">Evasions</a> spell, <em>Speed I</em>. He has a tiny sliver of marble with 1 charge. Because it is a tiny-common catalyst, the marble contributes no PP to the spell. Brother Opal must expend both of the 2 PP required for the spell. The last charge in the marble is expended and it becomes a "dead" crystal. It can no longer be used as a catalyst.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 3</strong> After falling off of a cliff, Brother Opal suddenly decides he wants to cast the 2<sup>nd</sup> level <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.6.5">Monk's Bridge</a> spell, Landing. Fortunately he has a medium gray diamond with 9 charges. Because it is a medium-rare catalyst, the diamond contributes 6 PP to the spell. Brother Opal must spend at least one of his own PP to the spell, bringing the total spent to 7 PP. If Opal's casting required a Spell Casting Static Maneuver Roll, he could add +5 (for the 5 extra PP spent on the spell). The gray diamond now has 8 charges.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="EC_6.5">6.5</a> NOMENIST</h2>
<p>Nomenists are spell users who control the <span id="essence">Essence</span> through their knowledge of words of power, also known as the Primal Tongue. Because the Primal Tongue is ever changing and impossible to catalogue, Nomenists must continuously study languages old and new to find resonances of this Primal Tongue. Nomenists may study alone in libraries or venture abroad to experience language in its natural state. Primal Tongue cannot be taught like any other language because it is not a true language. Certain words, sounds, or concepts must be rediscovered over and again. The word or sound may hold power, but only certain individuals can unlock it. Not all words or sounds work for all individuals because the Primal Tongue is a living language that interacts with the individual in mysterious ways. Any book written about the Primal Tongue is only true for the individual who wrote it, though parts of the book may also be true for others.</p>
<p>Because a Nomenist derives his power and knowledge of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> by virtue of his mastery of the Primal Tongue, he cannot learn any spell that has a higher level than the number of ranks he has in Primal Tongue. The principal advantage to using this method of casting is speed, as shown on the Modified Spell Casting Static Maneuver Chart.</p>
<p>For a Nomenist to learn about the Primal Tongue, he must learn many languages and sounds to find which ones speak to him. While all languages can reveal insights to the Primal Tongue, certain languages are closer to the Primal Tongue than others. To classify how much of the Primal Tongue a character knows, the GM should assign a tier for each language in his campaign. All of the languages in the <em>RMSS</em> are assigned a tier.</p>
<p>A tier 1 language is assumed to be a fairly modern language in common usage. The higher the tier, the more ancient and magical the language (i.e., closer to the Primal Tongue). The Language Tracking Sheet, found at the back of this book, should be used for organizing the languages by tier.</p>
<p>A character's skill ranks in the Primal Tongue is calculated by the following formula.</p>
<code><pre>
# ranks spoken of tier 1 languages (x1) +# ranks spoken of tier 2 languages (x2) +# ranks spoken of tier 3 languages (x3) + etc.
</pre></code>
<p>The rank of Primal Tongue should be recalculated each time a character develops more ranks of spoken languages. When developing these new languages the character should obey all rules in the section on Learning Languages and in the section on Magical Languages.</p>

<h2><a name="EC_6.6">6.6</a> SOMANTICS</h2>
<p>Somaticism is often considered the simplest and most basic of the schools of magic. Somaticists do not have to seek out strange catalysts for their spells nor do they have to learn esoteric languages to increase their knowledge of magic. Instead, Somaticists learn to manipulate the <span id="essence">Essence</span> through the combined effort of their will and their movement.</p>
<p>Somaticists tend to be elegant, graceful, and agile, but there are some guilds that have learned "jerky" methods of somaticism. Somaticists require less study and time than the other schools of magic, because the caster has no need to learn a large number of catalysts or languages. This makes the Somatic School of Magic a popular method of spell casting, especially among Semi spell users and Non spell users. Pure spell users of <span id="essence">Essence</span> tend to find the other schools of magic provide either more power or greater speed than the simpler Somatic School.</p>
<p>The caster evokes the power of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> through the use of gestures, expressions, dances and movements. Somaticists do not have to speak when casting, but it is assumed that they generally whisper some mnemonic phrases to aid in recalling the proper gestures. The caster gains no special benefits from this method of casting, but itis fairly straight forward and requires no additional record keeping for the player. Somaticists obey all the normal rules of spell casting, except they now obey the new modifications to the Spell Casting Static Maneuver Table.</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the GM desires to use the various schools of magic in his world, Somaticism can be used as a baseline, as opposed to standard spell casting from the RMSR. Perhaps there are players who want to play Essence users, but don't want to deal with the extra record keeping involved with the other schools. Perhaps the GM does not wish to burden a new player with the additional complexity ofthe Nomenist or Catalyst casters. Maybe he just doesn't want to have to juggle catalysts for the NPCs during a battle. Whatever the reason, Somaticism provides a simple answer to the question ofSchools of Magic.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="EC_6.6.0.0.1">6.6.0.0.1</a> Hybrids</h5>
<p>Hybrid spell users who specialize in the realm of <span id="essence">Essence</span> also learn their base lists and all <span id="essence">Essence</span> lists subject to the schools of magic. All channeling or mentalism spells they learn are not subject to the schools of magic. Any rules regarding channeling or mentalism that are introduced in their respective companions may either be applied in addition to or opposed to the schools of magic as the OM determines is appropriate for his world.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_6.6.0.0.2">6.6.0.0.2</a> Cross Training in Schools of Magic</h5>
<p>There may be times when a character desires to learn from different schools of magic. A character may learn from different schools either because he only has access to diverse sources or because he wishes to complete his knowledge on a given subject. This means that a character may have a different school of magic for each spell list he learns. The school will always coincide with the school of the character's source document or teacher.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that a character already knows a spell list by a given school, Nomenist for example, and then discovers a tome that teaches that same spell list by another school, crystal catalyst for example. The character may decide to relearn the list by the second method in order to further his understanding of the list. If a character does this, then any spell he casts from the list may use the guidelines for either of the two schools or both. If the character uses both, then the greatest modifier for each method is applied to any spell casting maneuver.</p>
<p>Cross training in schools ofmagic vary the costs for spell development. If the character is developing a spell list using a school of magic other than his primary school of magic it costs +1 DPs per rank. If the character is developing a different method for a spell list he already knows to that level then it costs -1 DPs per rank.</p>

<h2><a name="EC_6.7">6.7</a> SPELL CATEGORIES</h2>
<p>This section contains a master listing o f all spell lists in the <em>RMSS</em>. This list is sorted by spell categories (which are usedfor the purposes of magical rituals, among other things).</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/7.0/LEARNING" -->
<h1><a name="EC_7.0">7.0</a> LEARNING</h1>
<p>One of the most important concepts in Rolemaster is learning. Without the possibility of improving one's character, adventuring has little point. This improvement can take the form of unlocking the truth behind a single burning question or it can be the development of an entirely new skill.</p>
<p>The development point system is designed to reflect the aptitudes of different professions and therefore dictate which skills the character can improve easily and which ones require a bit more effort to learn. It does not however, take into account other factors in the learning process. Availability ofleaming sources, the quality ofthese sources, additional time spent studying, and experimentation all have a large impact on how easily and how well a skill is learned.</p>
<p>The sections below outline some suggestions as to how these factors can be represented in the game. All of these sections are optional and the GM may find that not all ofthem are appropriate to his campaign. Although they are all presented under the learning section, each set of rules below can stand alone. Game balance should not be affected if the GM opts to use some but not all of the sections below.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/7.1/LEARNING SPELLS" -->
<h2><a name="EC_7.1">7.1</a> LEARNING SPELLS</h2>
<p>One ofthe things that a GM should define at the outset of his campaign is what the requirements are for an <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell user to learn spells in the various categories. <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell casting is a process of understanding the rules that one must obey in order to achieve a specific spell effect. The basic understanding of these rules (which allow a caster access to a spell list in the first place) are not intuitive. They do not come naturally. They must come from an outside source, typically a magical tome or a teacher.</p>
<p>When it comes to casting spells from another realm, <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell casters must have an instructor or mentor to tutor them in the basics of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> or <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>. Without such a teacher <span id="essence">Essence</span> casters are incapable of understanding the basic religious or philosophical foundations required to cast the very different types of spells the other realms emphasize. Of course, in the case of hybrids, this requirement applies only to the realm which is not part of their profession already.</p>
<p>Once a character has acquired the necessary resources to learn a certain spell list, it can be determined how well the spells were learned. This determination is modified by a variety of circumstances. The primary factor in a character's education is the source from which he learns his spells. The most common methods are listed below.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/7.1.1/MAGICAL TOMES" -->
<h3><a name="EC_7.1.1">7.1.1</a> MAGICAL TOMES</h3>
<p>Magical tomes are defined as any writings that contain the knowledge necessary to cast one or more spells from a given list. These books are not themselves magical, although they often have wards and other protective magics placed upon them to keep out the elements (and curious). Magical tomes are often written in ancient or magical languages (not to be confused with runes) or are written in the special language of a certain profession. Regardless of their form, magical tomes are an extremely valuable resource for learning spells for two main reasons: portability and reusability.</p>
<p>Because it is often difficult for a caster to remain near his mentor for years on end, a magical tome can be the answer to his problems. A master may loan him a book that describes how to cast certain spells so that the caster can continue his education while he is on a long journey. This allows a caster to travel to far away lands where his master is inaccessible without bringing his education to a halt.</p>
<p>The other advantage of magical tomes is that they are reusable. If a master or guild wants all its students to learn a specific list, they simply give each student in turn access to a magical tome that adequately describes the spells in question. This frees a mentor to pursue his own goals while the student caster learns basic ideas from the book.</p>
<p>Magical tomes are not typically found in libraries or common book stores unless the GM is running a very high magic campaign. Such knowledge as is found in magical tomes is closely guarded by individuals, guilds, or even universities of magic. This is especially true of base list tomes. The only thing that really makes a spell casting profession powerful is that they can cast spells that other professions cannot. If the knowledge necessary to cast their base lists were commonly known, the profession would cease to have a firm hold on their niche in the world. Their secrets would be known and ways would be found to render their potent magics ineffective. Characters of a profession may well be given magical tomes to help them learn their base lists, but such tomes are usually given with the unequivocal understanding that the knowledge contained in those books is for their eyes only! If the other members of a profession discover that a character has been letting others use the magical tomes or has been teaching the spells themselves, the consequences could be dire. Knowledge is power and is not freely distributed to any who ask for it.</p>
<p>A particular magical tome may be a better or worse set of instructions on how to cast a given spell list. For this reason, a special modifier of no more than + or -15 could be added to Learning Static Maneuver Table in the case of exceptionally good or bad learning materials (see <a href="#C_7.3">Section 7.3 for rules on "Learning Skills"</a>).</p>
<p>Another variety of book used by many <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell casters is the lore book. Lore books do not contain the knowledge necessary to learn to cast spells, but rather are a valuable resource for research. They may deal with topics that are magical in nature, but this information is not enough to actually learn any spells. For example there might be a certain lore book that deals with circles. The GM may decide that this book contains information on how to draw basic magical circles, discusses the evolution of different patterns of runes in circles, etc. This might be an excellent resource work to use if a caster were learning <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html##SL_3.2.2">Gate Mastery</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.1.8">Rune Mastery</a>, or <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#EC_14.3.1">Circle Law</a>. Lore books are not as valuable as magical tomes, but they are also much more available. It is not uncommon to find such books in libraries, but those that stray close to topics dealing with certain professions base lists are still closely guarded by the guild.</p>
<p>Still another kind of book found in the hands of <span id="essence">Essence</span> casters is the spell book. These are the powerful works compiled by the most skilled masters of the magical arts. Not only do they contain all the information for learning to cast spells from a certain list (often with a bonus and often all the way to 50th level), but they are crafted on rune paper. This means that any spell in the book may be cast as though it were a rune of that particular spell. Casting a spell in this way deletes it from the book, and thus drastically reduces its value as a research book. Spell books are extremely rare and heavily guarded with powerful magics by the masters and guilds that own them. Anyone caught stealing them, selling them, or worse, casting spells from them would be dealt with very harshly by the owner.</p>
<p>Spell books are not sold. In rare circumstances, they might be traded to someone in the same profession for another spell book or perhaps an artifact quality magic item. If for some reason a monetary value must be placed upon one of these most powerful of books, the GM should assign a cost relative to the economy in his world. It is rumored that entire kingdoms have been ransomed for a set of base list spell books.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_7.1.1.0.1">7.1.1.0.1</a> Physical Dimensions of Magical Tomes</h5>
<p>An average magical tome is approximately 9 to 10 inches wide and 11 to 12 inches tall. They typically have leather covers, often fashioned from the hide o f a magical creature. They will have sturdy bindings and some will have hinges of leather or metal along the spine. It is not uncommon for the cover to have its corners sheathed in metal to protect them from damage. Some have the edges protected with thin metal plating. Such books often have locks on them. The thickness varies by the numberofpages in a book. The GM may decide how many pages a spell occupies, but a suggested minimum is one page per spell level (e.g. 1st level spells take one page, 2nd level take two, 3rd level take three, etc.). If the OM desires, he may wish to use the table below to determine how many pages each spell takes up. On average, a magical tome will be 1 inch thick for every 50 pages it contains because of the thick parchment such tomes are usually inscribed upon. Weight is approximately 2 lb. plus 1 lb. per inch of thickness. Lore books are not always so protectively covered, but otherwise generally conform to the physical description of magical tomes. Spell books are even more protectively covered, often using hides from dragons, demons or other rare creatures for their covers. Their bindings will be made from the most exotic metals available.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_7.1.1.0.2">7.1.1.0.2</a> Cost of Magical Books</h5>
<p>Lore books are usually priced between 5 and 25 gp depending on how well known the author is and how many spell lists the information within pertains to. Each spell list after the first for which the lore book can be used as a reference should add about 5 gp to the sale price. If a copy can be located in a library then the normal library study rates apply.</p>
<p>Due to the extremely valuable nature of magical tomes to those who possess them, they are very rarely bought and sold. Those who hold powerful positions in the magical community do not like to see the ability to cast high level spells being bartered back and forth in the streets like a sack of wool. The GM may even decide to make it illegal for non guild members to even be in possession of such a book. However, there are circumstances where a monetary value may need to be placed upon such a work. In that event, the following prices for magical tomes are suggested.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/7.1.2/MENTOR" -->
<h3><a name="EC_7.1.2">7.1.2</a> MENTOR</h3>
<p>Mentors are those spell casters who have decided to take on apprentices to teach them some of what they have learned. A mentor does not have to be of extremely high level. They only need to know more than their students and have a willingness to convey some oftheir knowledge. Of course, the more a mentor knows, and the better he is at teaching that knowledge to others, the more valuable he will be to his students. Mentors who are wise and good at teaching may be highly sought after. This is good for everyone, because the mentor can afford to choose only the brightest students, and the students will be motivated to learn to stay ahead of their peers.</p>
<p>Learning from a mentor is superior to learning from a book. Whereas a student can only read from a book and try to make sense of what he reads, he can ask questions of his mentor and concentrate on areas where he is having difficulty. The mentor can have the student perform exercises and practice with certain skills and spells to strengthen the areas thementor feels are important.</p>
<p>The relationship between a mentor and an apprentice can vary widely. The mentor could be a kindly elder of the village who enjoys the company of the apprentice. He could be a miserly old mage who only wants the character around to perform menial labor. The mentor might spend every possible moment striving to make his student the best he can be. Or the mentor might be too wrapped up in his own research to spend more than minimal time with the apprentice. All of the possible variables are left to the OM and player to decide together, or they can refer to the Spell Resource Background Table.</p>
<p>The mentor and apprentice have certain responsibilities to each other. The exact nature of these responsibilities should be worked out between the OM and the player before play begins, but some of the common obligations are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mentor must provide room and board for the apprentice for the duration of the apprenticeship. This includes the cost of travel on any journey where the mentor requires the accompaniment of the apprentice.</p></li>
<li><p>Mentor must make himself or other study materials available to the apprentice in such a way that the apprentice can continually add to his knowledge. Note that this rule is subject to interpretation by the mentor.</p></li>
<li><p>Mentor must not knowingly harm the apprentice or allow him to perform experiments or cast spells that are unusually dangerous.</p></li>
<li><p>The mentor and apprentice agree to try to protect one another from dangerous outside influences (enemies) up to, but not necessarily including, the risk of their own lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Apprentice agrees to obey any and all instructions given by the mentor.</p></li>
<li><p>Apprentice must turn over all "treasure" acquired during any undertaking he performs during his period of service to the mentor. Some of this may be returned to the apprentice, depending on the mentor's attitude and demeanor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The breach of the terms of the apprenticeship by the apprentice or the mentor can be a serious matter. If a mentor breaks the agreement, he may find it difficult to attract other students, and he may lose standing with his peers. If the apprentice breaks the agreement, it will be difficult if not impossible to receive additional instruction in the area. If the mentor has considerable influence, the apprentice may find that further instruction is unavailable nearly anywhere he goes.</p>
<p>The primary advantage ofhaving a mentor as opposed to one of the other resources for spell learning is the one on one instruction. Having a close relationship, wherein the mentor learns the best way to convey knowledge to his student and can closely monitor the student's progress, is a very efficient way to learn. Because this will almost certainly have a positive effect on the depth to which a student understands the material, any caster who studies a spell list under a mentor gains a +10 to the Learning Static Maneuver Table in addition to all other modifiers (see <a href="#EC_7.3">Section 7.3</a> for more on Learning).</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/7.1.3/GUILDS AND UNIVERSITIES" -->
<h3><a name="EC_7.1.3">7.1.3</a> GUILDS AND UNIVERSITIES</h3>
<p>A step beyond the mentor/apprentice relationship is the more formal education received in a guild or university environment. These institutions may not even exist in the GM's world. Although in many respects, being taught by several mentors is the same as being taught by one, in a few key areas the differences are very noticeable. Not only do these places of higher learning differ from a single mentor, they also differ from each other.</p>
<p>Guilds are defined as any group of spell casters who work in a more or less organized fashion for their mutual benefit. This can range from a group of <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Dabbler">Dabblers</a> who meet once a week to exchange information about potential robberies, to a coven of <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Magicians</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Illusionists">Illusionists</a> who have built a tower to house their massive library. The primary purpose of the guild is to provide greater safety, recognition, or resources through numbers.</p>
<p>Part of this mutual benefit can include the training of apprentices. This is helpful to the guild as a whole in several ways. First, it is always valuable to produce allIes, and an apprentice is likely to have a favorable predisposition toward his fellow guild members. As the apprentice grows in power, so does the guild of which he is part. In addition, there is always menial work to be done around the guild hall and students are known to be helpful when it comes to keeping the fire lit under your latest cauldron full of potions. But perhaps the primary reason many guilds take on apprentices is control. If a person has a magIcal aptitude, and your guild is not training him, some one else probably is. Keeping a gifted student out of the hands of other professions is always a good idea.</p>
<p>The arrangement between an apprentice and a guild is much like that with a mentor. Loyalty to the guild is stressed, and the benefits of lifelong membership are emphasized. These benefits vary widely based on the type of guild, but could include such things as access to the guild library, use of apprentices to help conduct research, and calling on fellow guild members in time of need. As wIth the mentor, breach of whatever terms are agreed upon can have dire consequences.</p>
<p>Magical universities are institutions that specialize in conveying knowledge to those who wish to learn. A "university" can be as simple as a couple of learned spell casters who want to help their fellows along, or as complex as a fully staffed college with dozens of instructors who teach all manner of spell casters in a variety of major and minor subjects. A GM should determine what constitutes a university in his world.</p>
<p>The primary difference between a university and a guild is that while apprentices in a guild setting are being taught in exchange for work and future benefits to the guild, students in a university usually receive instruction in exchange for some material consideration, most often money. This means that while it will almost certaInly be more expensive to attend a university, neither the casternor the institution bear as much responsibility to the other as with a guild. In general, a much more civilized society is necessary to create the level of informational freedom required to make a university possible. The instructors at a university must reveal many of the secret ways of magic to students who will have no binding allegiance to the school later in their careers (in fact, when the old school starts calling asking for those yearly contributions to the alma mater, a very real animosity may start to develop). For this reason, magical universities will be rare in all but the most high magic campaigns. It may be that only a single such institute will exist in an entire kingdom, or even the world. Competition to get into such a school could be fierce, and complex means of testing prospective students may be devised by the faculty to insure that only the cream of the crop are admitted.</p>
<p>Once admitted, the routine for a student can range widely. Some universities will place heavy emphasis on research and study. In these places, students will spend a great deal of their time in the library, poring over tomes written by the masters of the craft. Other institutions will have a more practical approach, requiring that pupils practice their spells over and over until their casting is second nature.</p>
<p>Whatever method is used at a given guild or university, the single greatest advantage of utilizing a multi-instructor environment is diversity. The broad range of skills, spells and even mundane knowledge found in such places makes them fruitful places to study. While a single mentor may be better at instructing a single student, with this closer bond comes the unfortunate fact that the apprentice is limited to the teaching resources of an individual. When the student is free to draw upon the expertise of many instructors, not to mention the libraries that guilds and universities often contain, his selection of spells broadens. The hazard of becoming a carbon copy of the mentor is removed, and the student is free to discover which areas of spell castIng are ofmost interest to him and at which ones he excels. For this reason, any <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell user who has a guild or university as a learning resource may learn more than 5 spell lists per level at the normal cost (see below). Obviously, these lists must be available at the institution in question.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_7.1.3.0.1">7.1.3.0.1</a> Guild Stats</h5>
<p>At certain times the GM may find it necessary to quickly generate the general statistics of a magical guild or university. The following chaarts may be used to determine some of the institution's basic characteristics.</p>
<p>With these basic characteristics in place, the GM can flesh out the guild as he sees fit. Some further questions to answer could include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the guild's attitude toward outsiders and prospective members?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the guild actively recruiting new members?</p></li>
<li><p>How difficult is it to become a member?</p></li>
<li><p>How extensive are the guild's library and other research resources?</p></li>
<li><p>How much political and commercial influence does the guild have over the community?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the guild interested in keeping it's existence secret?</p></li>
<li><p>If other guilds and organizations are present in the area, what alliances, friendships, hostilities or wars exist between them and the guild in question?</p></li>
<li><p>How long has the guild been present in the area?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the guild's long term and short term goals?</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/7.1.4/SELF-TEACHING" -->
<h3><a name="EC_7.1.4">7.1.4</a> SELF-TEACHING</h3>
<p>It is possible to learn magic without benefit of either teachers or books. This process of self teaching or extrapolation is not easy. First of all, the character must have witnessed the spells in effect or have had them explained to them in detail. Furthermore, he must have developed at least one rank of the spell list from another source (book or instructor). Once the initial rank(s) are purchased, it is possible for the caster, through experimentation and trial and error, to develop the list further without instruction from an outside source. This is a slow and dangerous process that can require a great deal more time than normal spell learning. It is very rare for an <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell caster to try to self teach in this manner. Usually only those who have no access to books or instructors, for one reason or another, will attempt to increase their spell casting abilities in this way.</p>
<p>Because of the disadvantages to this method oflearning, all spell list skills are classified as restricted and the character receives a -50 to the Learning Static Maneuver Table roll (see <a href="#EC_7.3">Section 7.3</a> for more information on Learning).</p>
<p>Self teaching should not be confused with Spell Research as detailed in a following section. Spell Research is a very long and involved process used for developing entirely new spell lists or adding to existing lists. Self teaching involves attempting to mimic effects based on a rudimentary knowledge and an awareness of the possibilities of existing spell lists.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 1:</strong> The GM may decide that only a certain number of ranks in given spell list can be learned without reference to a book or teacher. If this is the case, it is suggested that the list be broken into blocks by level of spell (typical blocks are 1-5,6-10,11-15,16-20,25-50). Require that the caster have learned at least the first spell in the block by normal means (book or teacher) in order to self teach the remainder of the block.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 1:</strong> If the GM wishes to allow the self teaching of the initial spell on the list (or block as in option 1), it is suggested that the research skill be used.</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/7.2/LEARNING LANGUAGES" -->
<h2><a name="EC_7.2">7.2</a> LEARNING LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>In almost any <em>Rolemaster</em> campaign there will be a multitude of different languages spoken by the varying races and cultures. Characters in the campaign will almost certainly want to become better at speaking the languages they know, and learning the ones they do not. In order to achieve greater fluency in a broader number of languages, a character must have a teacher. Unlike many other skills, where simply performing an action frequently leads to greater proficiency, language must be conveyed by someone more knowledgeable. If you only know a dozen words in another language, no matter how often your repeat them, you will never be much of a conversationalist.</p>
<p>What qualifies someone as a language teacher? Anyone who is more fluent (has more ranks developed) in a language than the character can serve as a teacher. However, those who specialize in conveying knowledge to others would almost certainly lessen the amount of time it takes to learn a new tongue or to improve an old one. In Rolemaster, this translates into fewer Development Points. Simply multiply the Teaching skill bonus of the instructor (expressed as a percentage) by the total number of DPs the character is spending on languages learned from that teacher, and then subtract that number from the total DP cost for the language.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Brother Opal the monk has come to the land of the Avemi Barbarians from his monastery in the highlands of the Empire of Rahad. Since he is supposed to be an ambassador and diplomat, Brother Opal decides he had better pick up some of the Avemi tongue quickly. Fortunately his new friend Vaughan, high priest of the Avemi tribe, is only too happy to help Brother Opal. Vaughan has a +28 Teaching skill. Opal decides to pick up 3 ranks (the maximum) of Avemi this level. This would normally cost Opal 9DPs, but multiply that by .28 (.252) and subtract this from 9 (6.48) and round normally (6). Thus it will cost Opal6DPs to develop three ranks of Avemi. Opal had better enjoy this while it lasts. Vaughan won't be so forthcoming with his linguistic prowess when he finds out that Brother Opal tumed the holy vines around the altar into a tossed salad.</blockquote>
<p>Finding a teacher may not be easy if the language is that of a culture the character is not on friendly terms with. Also, most teachers, unless they are personal friends of the character, will demand payment for their services. This amount will vary based upon how good the teacher is, how many other students wish to learn the language, and how many other teachers there are. Regardless of what arrangements are made to pay for the teaching, the GM should make sure that the character spends significant game time with the teacher.

<p>For those GMs who elect to use the Nomenist school of magic, the standard languages in the <em>RMSS</em> should be assigned "tiers" as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Tier III</strong>&mdash;any language that the GM designates as being very ancient (and generally unchanging)</p>
<p><strong>Tier IV</strong>&mdash;any language that the GM designates as being very ancient and magical</p>
<p>GMs should not make every language in their worlds known to the players at the outset (and the ones they do know should be Tier I and Tier II only). Rather, allow them to hear rumors of lost civilizations and ancient writings. If the players follow up on these hints, let them journey to far away places to uncover these languages of the past. Also note that no language of Tier V or greater should be discovered unless there is a very good reason for some shred of an extremely ancient (10,000 years +), magical language.</p>
<p>The GM should feel free to modify the cost for developing languages if he feels that a particular language is especially difficult to learn. It may be that a language is so radically different in structure, that it requires more time and effort to learn it. A language that expresses everything as a metaphor, has no pronouns, has only pronouns, or whose only verbs are variations of "swim" might be good examples. Any language that is spoken by a race whose vocal structure is different from humanoid should be classified as a Restricted skill.</p>

<h3><a name="EC_7.2.2">7.2.2</a> MAGICAL LANGUAGES</h3>
<p>Magical languages are a combination of contrived and unusual languages that can be used to increase the power an scope o f spells. All of the languages listed below may be used in conjunction with any of the spell lists within the associated spell category to derive special benefits. Magical languages may be used by all schools of magic, not just by the Nomenist. In many ways it is easier for all of the other schools to utilize these languages, since the Nomenist must synthesize any magical language with his Primal Tongue.</p>
<p>Magical languages are generally Tier 1 languages for Nomenist purposes. Even though these languages are closely tied to specific effects, they are too restricted in scope and too removed from the Primal Tongue to be of much additional benefit. A Nomenist learns a magic language for greater control over a category of magic, not too increase their understanding of the Primal Tongue. Because these languages deal with such complex magical manipulations they are classified as Restricted skills.</p>
<p>Magic languages are often used in conjunction with various professional languages in magic tomes and research books. The synthesis of languages requires the reader to know both the professional tongue and the magic language in order to receive the full benefits of the magic source book. If a reader only understands one of these languages then they can only learn half of the resident information. It is up to the GM to decide exactly how this will effect character development.</p>
<p>Benefits for casting spells only apply for the spoken form of the magical language, unless the spell category is Enchantment-Variable, for which the ranks in the written language should be used. The following benefits are accrued by the caster for the spell category for each magical language he knows:</p>
<p>The caster may add the rank bonus in the magical language (+3 per rank) to the Spell Casting Static Maneuver roll for any spell in that category.</p>
<p>The caster may add +1 per rank in the magical language to any <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Spell_Mastery">Spell Mastery</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Spell_Artistry">Spell Artistry</a> skill rolls for spells in that category.</p>

<h2><a name="EC_7.3">7.3</a> LEARNING STATIC MANEUVER CHART</h2>
<p>The following is an optional chart that allows the GM to simulate extraordinary time and effort by characters in developing their skills. The results generated by this chart will affect the DP cost of a skill, reflecting the learning abilities of the character and the quality of the source from which he is learning. This chart is meant to be used only for skills which the character has studied intensively or for which he has an excellent source from which to learn. The GM should not find every character in his campaign rolling several times on this chart every level. Any reduction or increase in DP cost applies only to one specific development period and have no effect on DP costs for that skill beyond that development period. The player should be given the option of not paying the DP cost and not developing that skill for the development period after making the maneuver roll.</p>
<p>A spell caster who is using the Learning Static Maneuver Chart applies all of the appropriate modifiers for the learning method he is using for the spell list in question (magical tome, mentor, guild or university, or self taught) plus any applicable modifiers from the general modifiers category.</p>

<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/8.1/SPELL RESEARCH" -->
<h2><a name="EC_8.1">8.1</a> SPELL RESEARCH</h2>
<p>These rules provide the GM with an optional method for determining the research time required for introducing new spell lists. Under the spell research rules presented in <a href="5522.html"><em>Spell Law</em></a>, the time required to research a new list does not take into account the ability of the researcher, or allow for sudden breakthroughs (or mind blocks). Spell research is limited to Pure spell users and Hybrid spell users, as Semi spell users and non spell users do not have a great enough understanding of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> to study it in such detail. The following rules may be used as an alternative method for calculating spell research and incorporating it into the framework of a campaign world.</p>
<p>Before the researcher begins any project, he must clearly define his intention and projected goal. The following guidelines should assist the GM and the player in determining the basic parameters for any spell research project.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_8.1.0.0.1">8.1.0.0.1</a> Spell Design</h5>
<p>Six factors must generally be determined as the projected goal of any spell and spell list research:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>&mdash;What will the working title ofthe spell or spell list be? This helps the researcher label his research, for reference in his notes as well as for explaining to his wife why he must work late every night.</p>
<p><strong>Level</strong>&mdash;At what level on the list should the spell appear? Is it simple enough to be cast by a novice, or are its effects so far ranging and powerful that it requires a great deal of expertise and expenditure of spell points to cast?</p>
<p><strong>Class</strong>&mdash;The spell class (DE, F, E, Fm, Us, P, etc) must be determined.</p>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>&mdash;Will the spell affect one target or many? Area of effect, duration, and range desired must be assigned.</p>
<p><strong>Target Type</strong>&mdash;The structure and nature of the specific target must be taken into account in certain spell types. Factors both anatomical and mental must be recognized (e.g., the workings of the brain of human and demi-human races must be considered when writing a spell to affect the mind). Spells doing damage to physical targets must often be written with those targets in mind (spells such as <em>Earthquake</em> will likely require some knowledge of plate tectonics). Other attacks, such as <em>Fire Bolt</em>, may not have factors in their creation specific to a target; but simply deliver differing amounts and types of damage to different targets.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanics</strong>&mdash;Is this spell instantaneous? Are its effects dependent on the amount of the target's resistance roll failure? Must it be cast at night, daylight, or within a set range of a set element? The actual mechanical concerns of casting the spell must be considered here.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_8.1.0.0.2">8.1.0.0.2</a> Research Investment</h5>
<p>Once the spell researcher has clearly defined the target of his research, he needs to marshal and assemble his resources for the project. A researcher may use magical tomes, lore books, special catalysts, teachers, artifacts, or other worldly contacts as sources of additional information. All of these sources of additional information tend to be costly and difficult to find. The more sources (and the better the sources) a researcher has access to the better his chance of discovering positive leads, so good resources provide the researcher with a bonus to his studies.</p>
<p>The GM should require a minimum amount ofresources to begin a research project, which might include access to a guild-sized (and quality) library or a powerful mentor or artifact. Bonuses should be in proportion to source's benefit. The exact costs of these sources will vary widely depending on the GM's world and is left to his interpretation. The following guidelines should provide a basis for assigning bonuses or penalties for source material.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/8.2/USING THE SPELL RESEARCH CHART" -->
<h2><a name="EC_8.2">8.2</a> USING THE SPELL RESEARCH CHART</h2>
<p>The relative success of spell research is determined on the Spell Research Chart. This chart, like the maneuver charts, has a number of different "difficulty ratings," from Routine to Absurd. The appropriate difficulty must be assigned by the GM before a roll is made with any appropriate modifiers.</p>
<p>A researcher may choose to begin research on a whole list or he may elect to add on to existing lists. It is easier to add spells that are appropriate to an existing list (to fill in open slots), than to create an entirely new spell list that has similar spells. This variation in difficulty is taken into account in the difficulties proposed below.</p>
<p>The difficulty of a research project varies based on its size and scope. On the following chart, a known list is a spell list that the character already knows up to or beyond the point chosen for research; an unknown list is an existing list, that the researcher does not know, or he does not know up to the rank he wishes to research; a new list is a totally new and unconventional spell list the researcher wishes to invent from scratch. Individual spells can only be researched to fill gaps in existing lists, while new spell lists must be learned in blocks of five ranks at a time. The following guidelines should be followed for assigning difficulty for research maneuvers.</p>
<p>Once the GM has assigned the difficulty to the research roll and assigned all modifiers, the character makes his research roll adding his skill at research. The percentages on the chart indicate the percentage of the research completed after the effort represented by that particular research roll. The second number in each entry indicates how much time was required to complete the indicated percentage of the research.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 1:</strong><p>The quiet but sneaky magician, Ted, wishes to develop a spell to allow him to temporarily turn his Invisibility spell off without canceling the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Step One:</strong> Name. No special requirements as to the spell's name exist, so he decides to maintain his anonymity by calling it something generic, Appear.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Level. The spell will fill the existing gap between 4th and 6th level on Invisible Ways.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Class. The GM determines that the spell is Elemental in nature (E).</p>
<p><strong>Step Four:</strong> Parameters. Ted wants to be able to turn off his Invisibility spell for 1 round, be able to attack, and then the following round have his Invisibility spell turn on again. The spell will have a duration of 1 round, an area ofeffect ofthe caster, and a range of self.</p>
<p><strong>Step Five:</strong> Target. No special knowledge is required o f any specific target type.</p>
<p><strong>Step Six:</strong> Mechanics. The only special circumstance requiredfor this spell is that it only works when the spell Invisibility is currently active on the target.</p>
<p><strong>Step Seven:</strong> Research Investment. Ted has a vast library of his own, but unfortunately they are all paperbacks and can hardly be considered research material. Ted decides that he will have to use the local library for his research material, but when he approaches, the head librarian promptly screams for the city guards. Ted quickly leaves, wishing that he had returned those library books that he had checked out back when he was an apprentice around 10 years ago. Dispirited, Ted is forced to look for other sources.</p>
<p>Turning to his friend Ayric, who has access to a guild library, Ted tries to convince Ayric to help him "like a true pal. " Ayricagrees to let Ted use his pass to the library in exchangefor lunch and dinner every day that he needs access (as well as standard guild fees of 4 sp per 8 hour day).</p>
<p>Sighing, but not surprised, Ted agrees. It is not until much later into his studies that he discovers how much a tall, skinny guy could eat. His access to the library costs him around 5 sp per day.</p>
<p>The GM rules that since Ted is limited in his access, it only provides him with a -50 to his study rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Step Eight:</strong> Determine Research Time. Ted settles down in the guild library with a contented sigh and pulls a two liter green bottle o fsugar water out o fhis fuzzy green robe's pocket. He opens his first book and begins his research.</p>
<p>The spell he is researching is on a known list and it is less than the caster's level, so the difficulty of the research is Easy, but since this is a closed list the difficulty increases to Moderate. Ted rolls a 72 and adds his research skill bonus of82 and subtracts 50 for his sources for a total research roll of 104. Checking the Spell Research Chan, a 104 on the Easy column indicates that 90 percent of the research is complete after 250 hours of study. The GM determines that 8 hours a day is the maximum time that Ted can study, so after 32 days of straight studying, Ted is almost done. He's feeling good about things so he continues his research and rolls a 50 plus his research bonus of 82 minus 50 for sources for a total bonus of 82. Consulting the chart it indicates that after 250 hours Ted completes 70% of his research. The GM calculates this to mean that after 36 hours (5 days) o fextra studying Ted has fully researched his new spell. Now all Ted has to do is develop this spell at his next level advancement. And it only took him 37 days of studying and cost him 185 sp.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 2:</strong><p>Inspired by his friend Ted's sudden studiousness and industry, Ayric feels that he must outdo Ted. It is a moral imperative. He decides that he will invent an entirely new list based on molecular unbonding (whatever that is).</p>
<p><strong>Step One:</strong> Name. He decides he will call it <em>Ayric's Amazing Molecular Anti-Adhesives</em>. Hey, credit where credit is due, right?</p>
<p><strong>Steps Two through Six:</strong> The level, class, parameters, targets and mechanics will vary from spell to spell.</p>
<p><strong>Step Seven:</strong> Determine Research Sources. Not only does Ayric have access to the guild library, but he also student teachesfora high level master magician who allows Ayric to use his tomes and often speaks with Ayric, directing his research in subtle ways. The GM determines that this is worth a +20 to his research roll.</p>
<p><strong>Step Eight:</strong> Determine research time. The GM rules that the list Ayric wishes to learn is <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> in nature and powerful enough to be a closed list. Ayric is 15<sup>th</sup> level and he is attempting to create the first five levels of this entirely new list. This results in a Complex difficulty at first, but since it is a closed <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> list it increases in difficulty by two levels to Absurd.</p>
<p>Ayric, excited to begin a new project and invigorated by the challenge, stans early one morning and rolls a 52 on his research roll, which is added to his 100 research skill and the +20 bonus for resources for a total of 1721 Consulting the Spell Research Chan, Ayricfinds that after 2 years of studying he is only 35% of the way through developing thefirst 5 ranks of the new spell list.</p>
<p>Ayric looks back on his last two years with dismay, but hefigures if he can ever finish this list, he'll be guaranteed tenure. So back to the books he goes.</p></blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/9.0/USING RITUAL MAGIC" -->
<h1><a name="EC_9.0">9.0</a> USING RITUAL MAGIC</h1>
<p>Ritual magic involves long incantations that go far beyond the simple spell casting involved in nonnal magic. Rituals take much longer to cast and involve many more variables than standard spell casting, but this is offset by the greater control and power that can be achieved through a ritual. A ritual spell caster slowly builds up the power and complexity of a spell, instead of following a simple rote that rapidly and roughly casts a single effect. The slow build-up ofpower points in a ritual allows a low level caster to control powers of higher levels with greater ease. At the same time, the careful crafting of these power points grants the caster a greater control over every aspect of a spell.</p>
<p>The process of slowly shaping the <span id="essence">Essence</span> is difficult to master. The <span id="essence">Essence</span> is ever-shifting, making it difficult to manipulate slowly. For this reason, Ritualists have developed a number of different anchors for <span id="essence">Essence</span> being shaped by a ritual. These anchors are called influences by ritualists. Every ritual category has a number of different influences that can be used to help the caster anchor his magic. Some influences yield bonuses to the ritual, while others may only limit the penalties associated with trying to cast a ritual without the appropriate influences.</p>
<p>When a caster develops skill in ritual magic he must choose a ritual class. There are 20 ritual classes, each corresponding to the 20 different spell effects defined earlier in this book (charm, control, creation, dark, detection, earth, enhancement, enchantment-pennanent, enchantment-variable, inorganic modification, light, movement, obfuscation, organic modification, personal, protection, scrying, summons, water, and wind). When a character learns a class of ritual, he is not learning a specific spell or even a list of spells. Instead the ritual skill focuses on molding <span id="essence">Essence</span> towards a specific effect. For example, a ritual caster who studies the class oflight willieam various ways of invoking light and different ways of manipulating the light once it is created. A ritual caster can reproduce any effect listed on any list within his ritual's area of influence.</p>
<p>If a caster learns to use several ritual classes, he can combine these rituals into one spell effect by using the smallest skill bonus of the appropriate ritual. It is very difficult to combine these spell effects, so the ritual caster also receives a penalty for each additional ritual class he tries to combine. Even with these drawbacks, ritual casting is very popular due to its vast flexibility. In fact, rituals are so flexible that any caster attempting to use the skill Spell Mastery or Spell Artistry on a spell cast through a ritual receives a special bonus of +25 to the attempt.</p>
<p>When a caster decides to attempt a ritual spell, he first states his intention to do so and detennines the spell effect level. He then consults the Ritual Chart in order to detennine how long the ritual will take and how difficult the ritual will be. Next, the caster decides ifhe will use any catalysts, foci, or other influences in the ritual. Each category of magic has an individualized list of influences for rituals. A ritual caster must use a number or influences equal to:</p>
<p>(Level of Spell - Ranks in Ritual) or 2, whichever is greater</p>
<p>For each influence less than the required amount the caster uses, the caster receives a modifier of -25 to the ritual roll. Also, each category has a list ofdistractions that the GM may apply as penalties against the perfonnance of the ritual.</p>
<p>Assuming that the caster is not interrupted during his ritual casting time, the caster spends his power points at the end of the ritual and makes a <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Power_Manipulation">Power Manipulation</a> maneuver to see if he casts successfully. If the caster is interrupted during the ritual, he will lose all of the power points that he had devoted to the ritual and must make a maneuver roll to avoid a ritual spell failure. If the maneuver results in failure to cast the ritual, he must roll on the spell failure chart.</p>
<p>On the chart above, the difficulty and time required to complete a ritual is listed based on the level of the spell effect minus the caster's skill rank in the appropriate magic ritual level. If the caster is attempting to cast multiple spell effects, then the effective level of the spell is equal to the higher level of the two spells plus one half the level of all other spell effects. The caster must spend a number of power points equal to the effective level of the spell at the time it was cast.</p>
<p>For the following listing of influences, the duration of an influence only matters for physical items used in conjunction with a ritual. If the duration is F, then the item is only destroyed if the ritual fails. Otherwise the item may be used over and over. If the duration is 1, then the item is destroyed in the process of the ritual. If the ritual is halted early, then only a portion of the item may be recovered.</p>

<h1><a name="EC_10.0">10.0</a> FAMILIARS</h1>
<p><strong>Familiar</strong>&mdash;The caster can attune himself to a small creature (ofcreature intelligence) to serve as his familiar. The caster must obtain the creature through normal means (can be no more than 10% ofcaster's own mass) and cast this spell on the creature once per day for 1 week (concentrating for 2 hours per day). The caster can then control the familiar and view the world through its senses by concentrating on it (though the familiar must be within 50' per level). If the creature is killed, the caster will have a -25 modification to all actions for 2 weeks.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/10.1/NORMAL FAMILIARS" -->
<h2><a name="EC_10.1">10.1</a> NORMAL FAMILIARS</h2>
<p>Familiar is one of the most basic <span id="essence">Essence</span> spells in the game. Some players must have a familiar for every one of their <span id="essence">Essence</span> characters, while some have never felt the need to burden themselves with a "pet" (especially one that puts you at -25 for 2 weeks ifit dies). Although it is a basic spell, it leaves a great deal of room for interpretation and misunderstanding. Some clarifications and options for this spell are described below.</p>
<p>"The caster can attune himself a small creature (of creature intelligence) to serve as his familiar." We will cover what it means by "attune himself' later. What is meant by creature intelligence? Simply, any creature in "Creatures and Monsters" that is of "creature" intelligence. Most of these are covered in the Animals section. Any other creature that the OM deems to fall into this category should also be considered acceptable.</p>
<p>"The caster must obtain the creature through normal means" This line means that the Familiar spell does not supply the creature on its own. The creature must be purchased, captured, befriended, Summoned, or otherwise acquired before the spell is cast.</p>
<p>"(can be no more than 10% of the caster's own mass)" This qualification raises a whole bunch of other questions: Why can a troll have such a large familiar? Why must a pixie's be so small? The first clarification to be made is that the"10%rule" only applies at the time of the casting of the spell. The next clarification is that familiar should be limited to a maximum of approximately 20 pounds. The real purpose of this rule is to impose a mechanic to keep the characters from getting "combat" animals as familiars. Familiars should not be creatures that are normally involved in combat situations. With that in mind, GMs should consider relaxing this restriction if the players are being reasonable with their selection of familiars.</p>
<p>"cast this spell on the creature once per day for 1 week (concentrating for 2 hours per day)." Why must the spell be cast every day for a week and why does it take 2 hours per casting? This is more of a gray area and can be defined in different ways if the OM wishes, but one explanation is as follows: In exchange for the familiar's undying servitude and unswerving loyalty, the caster is imbuing the creature with part of his life force. This life force is the will and self determination that makes the caster a sentient being and not simply a living organism. It is because the familiar possesses a small portion of the caster's life force that the caster can transfer his consciousness and perceptions into the familiar. This transference of life force is not an enterprise to be undertaken lightly. The period over which the casting takes place and the time needed for each casting are, if anything, a bit conservative.</p>
<p>"The caster can then control the familiar and view the world through its senses by concentrating on it (though the familiar must be within 50' per level)." The caster can indeed control the familiar by concentrating on it. However, this should be difficult since the caster is almost certainly unfamiliar (pardon the pun) with how the familiar's body works. Imagine waking up one morning as a very different person (much taller, shorter, fatter, or thinner). You would be very clumsy in the new body until you became used to it. Therefore any maneuvers beyond simple locomotion should be at least at a Hard difficulty, modified by the caster's <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Situational_Awareness">Situational Awareness (Familiar)</a> skill. If the familiar is capable of flight, a maneuver roll is also required due to the complexity of that form of movement.</p>
<p>Viewing the world through the senses of the familiar is handled similarly. This includes such unusual senses as a bat's sonar ability or the composite vision of an insect. The caster must again make a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Situational_Awareness">Situational Awareness (Familiar)</a> maneuver to interpret the information gathered through the familiar's senses. The GM should base the difficulty ofthis roll on how different the familiar's senses are from those of the caster. To control or sense through the familiar, the caster must be within 50 feet per level. This does not mean that the familiar must constantly be inside this range. The familiar can be left behind on dangerous trips or sent miles ahead to scout. During these periods the caster cannot control the familiar or sense through it, but either can still sense if the other dies.</p><p>"If the creature is killed, the caster will have a -25 modification to all actions for 2 weeks." If the caster has transferred part of his life force to the familiar and the familiar dies, the life force dies with it. Having part of one's life force die is a traumatic experience (ask anyone who has ever fought the Undead). It will take a while for the caster to get used to it's loss, and even longer for the caster's life force to regenerate itself.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_10.1.0.0.1">10.1.0.0.1</a> Miscellaneous Notes</h5>
<p>While the familiar lives, it is nurtured and sustained by the caster's life force. Unless kiIIed by some outside force (violence, disease, malnutrition, etc.) the familiar wiIIlive as long as the caster does. If the familiar is outside the caster's range for a solid week, the bond between the caster and the familiar is broken and the familiar spelI must be "re-cast" on the animal. The caster does not suffer the "kiIIed familiar" penalty if this occurs. FinalIy, if the GM deems it appropriate, the caster can communicate in a rudimentary fashion (mostly through an empathic process) with his familiar. This option is strictly up to the GM and many GMs wiII not aIlow it at all.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option:</strong> If a familiar is "out of range" for a solid month, the bond between familiar and master is broken and the familiar spell must be recast.</blockquote>

<p>A true familiar (created using the 3rd level spell <em>True Familiar</em> from the <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#EC_14.3.5">Familiar Mastery</a> list) follows all the rules above for normal familiars with two exceptions: the maximum of 20 pounds does not apply (simply 10% of the caster's mass) and the link between the caster and familiar is never broken because of separation.</p>
<p>The bond between caster and true familiar runs even deeper than a normal familiar. In addition to sharing some ofthe caster's life force, a true familiar also shares a mental link with the caster. The caster is making a bond with the creature that is deeper than any other possible relationship. He is in essence setting up a unified consciousness between himself and the true familiar. A comprehension of this relationship is essential to understanding the obligations and affections between a spell caster and his familiar. When the caster first begins casting the True Familiar spell on a creature, a limited form of communication begins. An empathy forms between caster and creature. This sharing of emotion helps to convey the caster's intention to create a bond between them that can last for the rest of their lives. What he asks of the creature is friendship, companionship, assistance, strength, and unwavering loyalty. What the caster offers is friendship, companionship, a warm place to sleep, regular meals, refuge from the unforgiving wilds, and most importantly, sentience. The lure of this contract is usualIy enough to entice a creature to give up its life in the wild and become a familiar. Only if the creature is normalIy antisocial or belligerent, or if the caster treats the creature poorly, wiII it try to resist the spell.</p>
<p>Once the final casting has taken place, the creature is considered a true familiar. The bond between caster and familiar is complete and they now have a shared consciousness. This means that they can communicate almost instantly by thought as long as within range (50 feet per level). This communication begins as very basic emotions and pictures. Things like "hungry" or "danger" might be all the familiar or caster can convey at first. As time goes on the depth to which they understand each other leads to better and more complex communication. Either of the pair can read the thoughts of the other and send emotions through the link they share. Caster and familiar can never lie to one another under any circumstances. In this way, the familiar grows more and more self aware and intelligent until it can communicate large and relatively complicated pieces of information.</p>
<p>The benefits ofthis relationship for the caster are numerous. First is the obvious advantage of using the familiars senses as a remote point for scouting and observation. The familiar will certainly be able to go places the caster cannot, and may be able to sense things the caster is unaware of. If the caster allows the familiar to retain control of its body and senses and is simply along for the ride, the shared consciousness will alIow the familiar to interpret what it senses for the caster. If the caster takes control of the familiar, subverting its personality for the duration of the control, the caster should use his <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Situational_Awareness">Situational Awareness (Familiar)</a> skill as with a normal familiar.</p>
<p>The caster will never be alone again. He will always have the reassuring presence of his familiar in the back of his mind. This constant and steadying influence has saved more than one mage from the madness that often plagues the practitioners of the mystical arts. The familiar may be able to give insights and alternative perspectives on problems that present themselves. The matters on which the familiar wiII have input will begin simply (i.e., which of these berries are poisonous) butas it becomes more worldly through contact with the caster, the familiar will have more complex ideas. In a pinch, the familiar can even serve as a defender for the caster. While not normally very combative, the animals that serve as familiars can sometimes inflict nasty wounds. As time goes on, and the caster grows in power, the familiar may even learn a few magical tricks of it's own.</p>
<p>For the animal, the benefits of being a familiar far outweigh the obligations. It will live as long as the caster does, usually increasing it's normal life span by several times. It gains the protection of it's master and will almost certainly live a more pampered life than it would in the wild. The principal advantage from the familiar's perspective is that of increased intelligence. As a resident of the mind ofa mage, the familiar will undoubtedly gain insights unavailable to normal creatures of it's kind.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_10.2.0.0.1">10.2.0.0.1</a> Familar's Level and Stats</h5>
<p>All true familiars start off as first level familiars (this "level" is a measure of familiar ability and has no direct relation to its actual "level" for the purposes of RRs, etc.). As the caster gains more experience with his familiar, it is possible that the familiar will gain special abilities of it's own. These special abilities wiIl be tailored to the familiar's viewpoint, but can be very useful. To ensure that the familiar starts to gain these abiltiies, the caster must develop skiIl in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Familiar_Mastery">Familiar Mastery</a> (see <a href="#EC_5.4">Section 5.4</a> for a description of this new skill). The caster may make one static maneuver for each rank in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Familiar_Mastery">Familiar Mastery</a> that he has. For each success, the familiar gains one level. Note that a familiar can never be higher level than the number of ranks that the master has in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Familiar_Mastery">Familiar Mastery</a>.</p>
<p>The true familiar is also more intelIigent that normal creatures of its species. In game terms, the true familiar should have starting temporary memory and reasoning stats of 25 and potential stats of the caster's temporary memory and reasoning -(dIO-I). The true familiar should roll stat gains each time it gains a level. Because of the closer nature of the bond between master and familiar, the familiar is able to communicate in more than just an "empathic" sense to the master (thus, the master can say, "go check out the other room and report back what you find").</p>
<h5><a name="EC_10.2.0.0.2">10.2.0.0.2</a> Price to Pay</h5>
<p>While there are great benefits from having a true familiar, there is also a higher price to pay as well. Once your true familiar reaches fifth level, the master will suffer a -5 penalty to all actions when "out of range" of his familiar. This penalty increases by -5 for every five levels of experience the familiar gains. In addition, starting at fifth level, the penalty for losing the familiar increases by -5 each level. For example, if a fifth level familiar dies, the master will be at -30 for two weeks. I f a tenth level familiar dies, the master will be at -55 for two weeks!</p>
<h5><a name="EC_10.2.0.0.3">10.2.0.0.3</a> Familiar Abilities</h5>
<p>Finally, the true familiar will gain special abilities each time it gains a level. They may not use special abilities higher than their level. Each ability may only be used one time per day. Normally the familiar has control of when he chooses to use the abilities gained (not the master). However, if the familiar has not already used a given ability during a day, the master may concentrate on his familiar to use that ability.</p>

<h5><a name="EC_10.2.0.0.5">10.2.0.0.5</a> Familiar Ability Descriptions</h5>
<ol>
<li value="1"><p><strong>Uncaged</strong>&mdash;Allows the familiar to open one portal (door, window, drawer, etc.) that is not locked or barred in any way. The familiar must be able to touch the portal with some part of his body.</p></li>
<li value="2"><p><strong>Pacify Hunger</strong>&mdash;Allows the familiar to digest any organic material as though it were the appropriate food for its normal diet. This does not alter the taste of the food. This food substitute will quell hunger for approximately one hour.</p></li>
<li value="3"><p><strong>Static</strong>&mdash;For one minute, the skin of the familiar becomes charged with electricity. Any attacks against the familiar that cause a critical will result in an 'A' electricity critical to the attacker. Also, any attacks the familiar makes that cause criticals will inflict an additional 'A' electricity critical. The target of the electricity critical may make an RR to resist the effects.</p></li>
<li value="4"><p><strong>Speak with Kind</strong>&mdash;For the duration, the familiar can converse with any animal ofits general type (i.e., birds can talk to any birds, dogs could talk to any mammal, snakes could talk to any reptiles, etc.).</p></li>
<li value="5"><p><strong>Familiar's Spell</strong>&mdash;Familiar can store one of his master's spells for later use. When the familiar desires, the spell can be cast instantly.</p></li>
<li value="6"><p><strong>Great Attack</strong>&mdash;All attacks by the familiar for the next minute will have a special modification of +15 to the OB and will be one size larger than normal on the attack tables.</p></li>

<li value="8"><p><strong>Power Magnet</strong>&mdash;The caster's familiar becomes a power magnet. When this power is activated and the caster is within range of his familiar, he will gain one extra PP for each level of the familiar. These PPs are used first when casting spells (and do not affect the caster's normal PPs). This ability (when activated) only lasts for one hour.</p></li>
<li value="9"><p><strong>Silent Watcher</strong>&mdash;No sounds emanating from the familiar will travel more than I' from his location. This makes all attempts at <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Stalking">Stalking</a> +25, and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Hiding">Hiding</a> +10. This ability lasts for two hours.</p></li>
<li value="10"><p><strong>Repel Predator</strong>&mdash;Any creature of animal intelligence that approaches within 30' of the familiar must make a RR or flee. Use the familiar's level as the attack level for the RR.</p></li>

<li value="14"><p><strong>Summon Kind</strong>&mdash;The familiar may summon creatures that are ofthe same species as the familiar. The summoning will result in one level of creature(s per level of the familiar. For example, a 14<sup>th</sup> level dog familiar would summon 14 levels of dogs (normally dogs are 2<sup>nd</sup> level, so this would result in 7 dogs). The summoned creatures will understand the desires of the familiar and will work with him for up to two hours as long as they are not put in direct danger.</p></li>
<li value="15"><p><strong>Change Form</strong>&mdash;The familiar may alter his appearance to appear like any other animal of up to 200% of his normal mass or down to 50% of his normal mass. This ability lasts for up to two hours. Note that the familiar cannot "imitate" another animal (e.g., appear exactly like the princess' pet dog Fluffy), but it can look like a friendly dog.</p></li>
<li value="16"><p><strong>Distant Report</strong>&mdash;The familiar can communicate with his master if the master is within 1 mile per level of the familiar. This ability only lasts for up to 10 minutes.</p></li>

The familiar does not gain the ability to speak, but gains all physical abilities of a person (though using the physical abilities will take some time to get used to). This ability lasts for up to two hours.</p></li>
<li value="25"><p><strong>Summon Master</strong>&mdash;The familiar may summon his master to his current location. The master must be within 1000 miles of the familiar's current location.</p></li>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5603/11.1/COST FOR CASTING SPELLS" -->
<h2><a name="EC_11.1">11.1</a> COST FOR CASTING SPELLS</h2>
<p>Magic, just like any other skill, can often be traded or bartered for money, goods, or other services. Those <span id="essence">Essence</span> users who are not offin the wilderness plundering the hoard of some poor dragon, must earn their bread somehow. They often sell their services to support themselves. How much an individual caster charges for his time is up to him. Typically the answer is "whatever the market will bear."</p>
<p>The following breakdown gives a suggested daily wage that various essence spell casters may charge for their services. This daily wage covers a reasonable amount of spell casting, research, or advice as the OM determines is appropriate. As a general guideline, a reasonable amount of spell casting will not expend more than half of the spell caster's available power points in a day. Travel, excessive spell casting, unique spells, or danger pay will increase these wages considerably. These wages are loosely calculated based on the Employing Craft and Service NPC section of <a href="5521.html#GL_19.4"><em>GM Law</em> (Section 19.4)</a>. These professions might be guilded or have professional taxes that must be paid out of any daily wage (anywhere from 10% to 30% of the daily wage). The rates given below are just a guideline. There is especially a lot of room for flexibility as the character raises above tenth level, where good trade skills or reputation can negotiate much better rates.</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Level is 10</th><th>Level is >10</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Pure Spell Users</td></tr>

<p>For example, a 5th level illusionist may be hired to entertain at a banquet for a standard rate of 10 bp (1 sp) for the evening. A 10th level monk may be hired to guard one's house at the rate of 15 bp a day.</p>

<h2><a name="EC_11.2">11.2</a> SPELL SPECIALIZATION</h2>
<p>All <span id="essence">Essence</span> users (including Hybrids) now have a new option when they create their characters. This new option is known as Spell List Specialization. This option must be selected when the profession is chosen (at the same time that extra base lists would be chosen). This option may not be selected at any other time.</p>
<p>When a character who has Essence as one of his realms is created, he may select one <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell list (that is not Other Base) as his specialization. This spell list will now be classified as an Everyman skill. However, all other spell lists in the same category (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.hmtl#Spells_Own_Realm_Open">Own Realm &bull; Open</a> lists, <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Spells_Own_Realm_Closed">Own Realm &bull; Closed</a> lists, etc.) are now classified as Restricted.</p>

<h1><a name="EC_13.0">13.0</a> TRAINING PACKAGES</h1>
<p>The standard rules for Training Packages apply to all Training Packages presented here. For convenience, the key to the Training Package Entries is repeated here.</p>
<p>Four of the following Training Packages are labeled Lifestyle, but they reflect training gained from the various schools of magic. If a character wishes to choose one of these Lifestyle Training Packages, the GM should still allow them to choose any other Lifestyle Training Package if they so desire. This is because these Training Packages reflect the knowledge they would have gained as a basis for learning spell casting, and should not limit the caster from other Lifestyle Training Packages like <a href="../en.lproj/trainingpackages.html#DEMONOLOGIST">Demonologist</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_13.0.0.0.1">13.0.0.0.1</a> Training Package Entries</h5>
<p>Each training package gives a character one or more of the following benefits/disadvantages. In addition, each training package costs a number of development points (based upon the character's profession)</p>
<p><strong>Time to Acquire:</strong> This is the amount of time the character needs to train before gaining the benefits of the package. This time should be modified by a percentage equal to triple the character's SD bonus (expressed as a percentage).</p>
<p>For starting characters, total the amount of time spent in training packages and add it to the normal starting age to determine the starting age of the character (See <a href="5500.html#RMSR_17.1">Section 17.1 in <em>RMSR</em></a>).</p>
<p><strong>Starting Money:</strong> Some occupations (or lifestyles) have more or less starting money than others. Most packages list a modification to the "normal" starting money. This includes the starting type of coins (silver, gold, bronze, etc.). For example, if the normal starting money is 10 silver, the Adventurer package would have 10 silver plus d10(open-ended) silver.</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There is one notation unique to the packnges: d10 (open-ended). This means roll d10; if the result is 1 to 9, keep the result; if the result is a 10, roll d10 again and add it to 9; continue until a 10 is not the result.</blockquote>
<p>If the training package is developed after the Apprentice level, the starting money does not apply. When generating starting money, either the GM should make the rolls; or the player can simply take 51 (for each d100 roll) or 6 (for each d10 roll).</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> The GM should make a d100 roll (open-ended) for each item, adding the number in parenthesis after the item (the items should be rolled for in the order that they are presented). If the result is over 100, the character gains the special item or quirk. After successfully gaining one item, the chances of gaining any further items is halved (i.e. the number in parenthesis is halved). After successfully gaining another item, the next chance is halved again (repeating each time an item is gained). If no items are gained, the last item on the list is automatically gained (if the GM is unavailable to roll, the player should take the last item). If the package is developed after Apprentice level, the benefits gained here may be inappropriate (GM's discretion).</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The GM may choose to allow every character who develops a training package to have the last item in the list (even if previous items were gained).</blockquote>
<p><strong>Skill and Skill Category Ranks:</strong> All packages give some skill ranks and/or skill category ranks to the character. These skill ranks represent special training that comes with the occupation or lifestyle. Occasionally, the package will list Weapon/Attack. This means that the character can choose either a weapon skill rank or martial arts skill rank. In addition, a Training Package cannot raise a skill rank above 10th rank.</p>
<p><strong>Training Package Spell Lists:</strong> Certain training packages give ranks in training package spell Lists. Training package spell lists are a new category of skills in the <em>RMSS</em>. All training package spell lists are classified as Restricted skills unless the character is currently associated with the training package that awards ranks in that spell list. Note that "associated with" has no firm definition. The GM should judge whether is it reasonable for the character to still have normal access to the spells or not.</p>
<p>All training package spell lists are part of the Spell group (and will receive any profession bonuses appropriate to that group). There are two new categories that must be added to the Spell group to accomodate these new spells: <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Spells_Own_Realm_TP">Spells &bull; Own Realm Training Package</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Spells_Other_Realm_TP">Spells &bull; Other Realm Training Package</a>. The cost to develop Spells &bull; Own Realm Training Package is 8/8/8 for non-spell users, 4/4/4 for pure and hybrid spell users, and 6/6/6 for semi-spell users. The cost to develop Spells &bull; Other Realm Training Package is 16/16 for non-spell users, 8/8 for pure and hybrid spell users, and 12/12 for semi-spell users.</p>
<p><strong>Stat Gains:</strong> Some Training Packages allow the character to make extra stat gain rolls. This section shows which stats get the extra rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Background Options:</strong> You may spend a background option to decrease the cost of a training package for the Apprenticeship Development period only.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Qualifiers:</strong> This is a set of requirements that, if the character possesses all of the requirements prior to purchasing the training package, the character pays a lesser cost for the training package. The discount to the normal cost is shown after the qualifier.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle Skills:</strong> Normally, a training package cannot raise a skill above tenth rank. However, if a skill is designated as a Lifestyle skill, the training package ignores this limit and instead may raise the skill as high as fifteen ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Cost by Profession:</strong> This section shows how much the Training Package costs (in development points) for each profession. The professions are grouped by the books they were published in (starting with the professions in the <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>, then <a href="5600.html"><em>Arcane Companion</em></a>, then <a href="5601.html"><em>Treasure Companion</em></a>, then <a href="5602.html"><em>Martial Arts Companion</em></a>, then <em>Essence Companion</em>, then <a href="5700.html"><em>Black Ops</em></a>, then <a href="5701.html"><em>Pulp Adventures</em></a>).</p>

<p>Corpists are often considered macabre or evil. Corpists use the body parts ofcreatures in order to affect magic. The more magical the creature the better the catalyst, so Corpists are often quite eager to join with adventurers just for the opportunity to gather catalyst material. While Corpist casters can be quite likable in most respects, it is difficult to be used to the smell that often seems to follow them. Also, familiars (and their magicians) tend to be very wary of such casters.</p>

<p>For Crystalists, power and wealth are synonymous: the most powerful Crystalists also carry the most elegant gems and stones. Crystalist can enchant gemstones to become the fuel and catalyst for their spells. Each casting erodes a part of this enchantment, so the crystals must be periodically re-enchanted. Crystalist do not have to spend as much time scrounging for catalysts as Herbalist or Corpists, but instead they must constantly spend their time re-enchanting their crystals. Crystalists tend to be flamboyant and extravagant, often wearing as many precious gems as they can afford all at the same time.</p>

Like an apothecary, the potioner attempts to draw the essence out ofnatural herbs to capture them in a bottle, but it is a rare potioner who manages by such sciences to create herbal remedies better than the simple animists of the wild.</p>

<p>A spell student is taught the lessons of magic by a collegium or school of magic. Students learn magic from a number of different masters in classroom settings as well as independently in the college's library. Students have exposure to a tremendous variety of spell lists and magic theories, which often makes them the most educated of spell casters. Of course, students also tend to lack practical "real world" experience, having spent so much time cloistered in their studies. Students may either learn spells to assist them in city life or less often spells to assist in practicing abroad.</p>

<h1><a name="EC_14.0">14.0</a> ESSENCE SPELL LISTS</h1>
<p>This section lists all of the spells associated with the <span id="essence">Essence</span> realm. All of the standard rules, restrictions, and notations from <a href="5522/html"><em>Spell Law</em></a> are used here. For convenience, the spell description key is repeated here.</p>
<h4><a name="EC_14.0.0.1">14.0.0.1</a> THE SPELL DESCRIPTION KEY</h4>
<p>Several types of codes may follow the spell names in the listings: area of effect, duration, range, and type. In addition, some descriptions will explain that a particular spell has an RR Modification (shown with the notation <tt>[RR Mod: #]</tt>). This section presents a key to those codes.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_14.0.0.1.1">14.0.0.1.1</a> Special Spell Codes</h5>
<p><strong><tt>[RR Mod #]</tt></strong> &mdash; Any RRs against the effects ofthis spell are modified by #.</p>
<p><strong>&#42;</strong> &mdash; Instantaneous; spell does not require preparation rounds.</p>
<p><strong>&bull;</strong> &mdash; Spell does not require power points.</p>
<p><strong>&Dagger;</strong> &mdash; Part of a set of spells that must be thrown in conjunction with other spells continuously to be effective (or fully effective).</p>
<h5><a name="EC_14.0.0.1.2">14.0.0.1.2</a> Spell Types</h5>
<p><strong>E</strong> &mdash; Elemental spell. These spells use the force ofthe spell to manipulate physical elements (heat, cold, wind, light, water, earth, sound, smell, taste, touch). These elements (and not the spell) are used to either create a phenomena that can affect the physical environment of the target (e.g., a "wall" spell) or the sense of the target (e.g., an "illusion" spell). Because the elements are real, no Resistance Rolls are normally allowed.</p>
<p><strong>BE</strong> &mdash; Ball Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that attack an area with one of the physical elements.</p>
<p><strong>DE</strong> &mdash; Directed Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that directly attack a target with one of the physical elements. Such attacks are resolved on one of the "bolt" attack tables.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> &mdash; Force spell. These spells involve the direct manipulation of matter, energy, the elements, or living beings through the use of a spell's force. If the spell has a target capable of resisting, the caster make an attack roll on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.1">Spell Law Basic Spell Attack Table 5.1</a> to determine the RR modification for the target. Determine the type of armor the target is wearing and roll on the appropriate column of the table (using the Other column if nothing else applies). After determining the RR modification, the target makes an RR (on <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.10">Table 5.10</a> in Spell Law, using the target's level and the attacker's level as the indices).</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> &mdash; Passive spell. These spells usually only indirectly or passively affect a target. Thus, if an RR is allowed (GM' s discretion), its purpose is only to determine if the target is aware of the spell. Many detection spells are of this type.</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> &mdash; Utility spell. These spells only affect the caster, a willing target, or a target incapable of resistance. Thus, RRs are not usually necessary. A willing target who is capable of resisting may still be required to make an RR (GM's discretion), but it is modified by -50 (i.e., he mostly likely will not resist successful). Most healing spells are o f this type.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> &mdash; Informational spell. These spells involve gathering information through means that do not require RRs.</p><h5><a name="EC_14.0.0.1.3">14.0.0.1.3</a> Spell Sub-Types</h5>
<p><strong>s</strong> &mdash; Subconscious spell. These spells are capable of beingcast (or triggered) by the subconscious. The caster can always cast a spell of this type as a normal spell; and ifhe is unconscious (or is asleep or in a trance), a spell of this type can be cast by the subconscious as necessary (starting with the highest level spell needed). An exception to this is the <em>Stun Relief</em> spell. This spell may (at the option of the caster) be cast by the subconscious while the caster is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong> &mdash; Mental Attack spell. These spells affect the target's mind and are subject to mental defenses.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_14.0.0.1.4">14.0.0.1.4</a> Spell Area of Effect</h5>
<p><strong><em>x</em> target(s)</strong> &mdash; The spell affects <em>x</em> number of targets.</p>
<p><strong><em>x</em> target(s)/Ivl</strong> &mdash; The spell affects a number of targets equal to the caster's level times <em>x</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em> R</strong> &mdash; The spell affects all within a radius equal to <em>distance</em> in size.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em> R/IvI</strong> &mdash; The spell affects all within a radius equal to <em>distance</em> times the caster's level in size.</p>
<p><strong><em>area</em></strong> &mdash; The spell affects all within a fixed area of effect. Sometimes area will be specified as a specific target (e.g., 1 herb, I limb, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>caster</strong> &mdash; The spell affects only the caster.</p>
<p><strong>"&mdash;"</strong> &mdash; The spell has no area of effect.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> &mdash; The exact size of the area of effect depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<h5><a name="EC_14.0.0.1.5">14.0.0.1.5</a> Spell Durations</h5>
<p><strong><em>time</em></strong> &mdash; The spell has a fixed duration equal to time.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> &mdash; Concentration is required. Concentration takes 50% of the caster's normal activity. The caster can not cast any other spells while concentrating.</p>
<p><strong><em>duration</em> (C)</strong> &mdash; Concentration is required, except the period of concentration cannot exceed the duration given. The caster can stop concentrating and the spell effect will stop. If the duration has not expired, the caster can concentrate again and the spell effect will resume.</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> &mdash; Permanent. The spell has a permanent effect (in the sense of creating a "permanent" physical or mental condition). The effects of permanent spells that manipulate matter <strong>and</strong> require concentration will disperse according to the normal physical laws once concentration is no longer applied (e.g., a frozen body of water will melt normally, a bowl of boiling water will cool). A spell with a permanent duration may be affect by outside forces.  For example, the spell may be dispelled, cured, or otherwise disturbed by enchantment, physical force, etc.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> &mdash; Variable. The exact duration depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>"&mdash;"</strong> &mdash; Variable. The exact duration depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>time</em> / level</strong> &mdash; The duration is the <em>time</em> multiplied by the level of the caster.</p>
<p><strong><em>time</em> / <em>#</em> fail</strong> &mdash; The duration is based upon the difference between the target's modified RR and the minimum roll required to resist the spell (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.6">RMSR Section 23.6</a>). The duration is equal to this difference divided by <em>#</em> and then multiplied by <em>time</em>.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> 1 rnd/10 fail would mean that ifthe RR is failed by 20, the spell would lastfor 2 rounds.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="EC_14.0.0.1.5">14.0.0.1.5</a> Spell Ranges</h5>
<p><strong>self</strong> &mdash; The spell can only be cast upon the caster himself.</p>
<p><strong>touch</strong> &mdash; The caster must touch the target to create the effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em></strong> &mdash; The caster can be no further than distance to the desired area of effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em>/lvl</strong> &mdash; The distance to the area of effect can be no further than distance times the caster's level.</p>
<p><strong>unlimited</strong> &mdash; There are no limitations placed upon the distance to the area of effect.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> &mdash; The distance to the area of effect depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
