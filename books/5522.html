<h1><a name="SL_1">1.0 </a>Welcome</h1>
<p><em>Spell Law</em> deals with the integration of magic and spells into a fantasy role playing environment. It is designed to be used as part of the <strong><em>Rolemaster Standard System (RMSS)</em></strong> or as the spell system for other FRP games. In the latter case, it can be used as a whole or in parts.<br />
<em>Spell Law</em> provides a wide variety of options for the players. Spell users are allowed to know a large number of spells, but can only use a few before tiring and requiring rest. Real skill in play is emphasized, since the choice of a spell and its application to a given situation become the key points. To this end, <em>Spell Law</em> provides over 2000 spells based on three different realms of power (Channeling, Essence, and Mentalism) and 15 professions (i.e., character classes).</p>

<h2>Spell Lists</h2>
<h3>GENERAL GUIDELINES</h3>
<p>The spells contained in this book are organized into lists which reflect the similarity and basic applications common to the individual domains. Higher level spells found on a given list will reflect the increased knowledge and efficiency that comes from the use and practice associated with lower level spells on the same list. This reflects the learning process that accompanies development within a consistent spell grouping.<br />
The spell lists are also grouped in units. These collections are based on the spell users’ various backgrounds within the greater realms of power. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Lay_Healer">Lay Healer’s</a> background and living experiences often differ significantly from the past life associated with a “pure” Mentalist. Thus, certain spell lists will be easier for the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist">Mentalist</a> to learn; correspondingly, others will seem simpler to the Lay Healer. Each profession will find that their education is colored by their own background. Nonetheless, flexibility is emphasized.<br />
The spells are described in a standard manner, using a basic format that simplifies usage. Most spells are specific, while others are accorded great flexibility. The latter group’s spells have descriptions that are less concrete, providing the Gamemaster (GM) with a framework by which he can apply spell usages to variances in his world system or specific occurrences that demand certain flexibility. This may be particularly true with regard to powerful spells.<br />
Certain simplifications and organizational devices have been used to increase playability. Nonetheless, consistence and flavor are emphasized. After all, the world of spells is a rich one indeed.</p>
<h3>ROLEMASTER</h3>
<p><strong><em>Rolemaster Standard System (RMSS)</em></strong> is ICE’s complete fantasy role playing system, combining <a href="5520.html"><em>Arms Law</em> (<em>AL</em>)</a>, <em>Spell Law</em> (<em>SL</em>), <a href="5500.html"><em>the Rolemaster Standard Rules</em> (<em>RMSR</em>)</a> and <a href="5521.html"><em>Gamemaster Law</em> (<em>GML</em>)</a>. Spell Law provides the spell lists and attack tables for the system, and <em>the Rolemaster Standard System</em> fully describes their use within the system. Those players and GMs who are already familiar with <em>Spell Law</em> (from previous editions of <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong>) can use this book without any modification to the old system (though you should decide which edition of <em>Spell Law</em> to use when their is a discrepancy—there a quite a few changes to the old lists). For players and GMs who are using <em>Spell Law</em> without <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong>, you will need to familiarize yourself with the material in the appendices before just diving in.</p>
<h3>ROLEMASTER SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</h3>
<p>Rolemaster is supported by a variety of play aids. Such products can decrease the time and effort required for the creation of an exciting game, and increase the amount of realism and detail obtained during play. These play aids include:<br />
<em><a href="5540.html">Creatures &amp; Monsters&trade;</a></em> (<em>C&amp;M</em>) — ICE’s compendium of information and statistics for two key elements of fantasy role playing: creatures, and encounters. It also includes guidelines and statistics for dozens of new races.<br />
ICE’s <em>Middle-earth</em>&reg; Series — A wide variety of rules, guidelines, and modules for use with fantasy role playing in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<p>One of the basic aspects of this system is the use of spell lists and experience levels (or just levels). The ability to cast and learn spells is closely tied to a character’s level.<br />
Spells are grouped into lists. A spell list is an ordering of spells based upon the level, intricacy, and potency. All spells in a list have common characteristics and attributes, although each may have vastly different effects and applications. Spell lists are grouped into categories based upon professions and realms of power (Channeling, Essence, and Mentalism). There are 186 spell lists divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li> 15 sets of professional “base” spell lists (i.e., spell lists usually learned only by characters in that profession)</li>
<li> 1 set of “evil” spell lists for each realm of power (i.e., spell lists usually learned only by “evil” characters—see <a href="#SL_7.3">Section 7.3</a>)</li>
<li> 1 set of “closed” spell lists for each realm of power (i.e., spell lists usually learned by most characters who cast spells the realm)</li>
<li> 1 set of “open” spell lists for each realm of power (i.e., spell lists that are learnable by characters in any profession of the realm and even by some professions outside the realm)</li>
<li> 3 sets of “other” professional “base” lists (i.e., spell lists associated with non-standard professions—usually reserved for non-player characters).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Terms</h2>
<p><strong>Animal:</strong> A living creature capable of feeling and voluntary motion, but excluding those characterized as beings.</p>
<p><strong>Being:</strong> Any intelligent creature, including all humanoid types, enchanted creatures, etc. Intelligence should be characterized by system and/or Gamemaster.</p>
<p><strong>Herbs:</strong> A plant or plant part valued for medicinal qualities. Inanimate: Not having qualities associated with active, living, organisms; not animate.</p>
<p><strong>Inorganic:</strong> Involving neither organic life or products of organic life.</p>
<p><strong>“Lord” Spell:</strong> A spell is keyed to a 20th level effect and will normally be defined in multiples/increments of 20.</p>
<p><strong>“Mass” Spell:</strong> A spell with its “# of targets” or its “area of effect” based upon the caster’s level.</p>
<p><strong>Organic:</strong> Of or deriving from living organisms.</p>
<p><strong>Slaying item or weapon:</strong> An item or weapon specifically designed to combat and/or destroy a being or type of being (e.g., a Dragon-slaying sword or staff).</p>
<p><strong>Spell points:</strong> The same as term Power Points”.</p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> The term “target(s)” refers to the being(s), animal(s), object(s), and/or material that a spell is attempting to affect.</p>
<p><strong>“True” Spell:</strong> A “True” spell is the highest level version of a specific spell type. Its potency will define the upper limit of the effect(s) derived from a given spell.</p>
<p><strong>Wound:</strong> An injury in which the skin is torn, pierced, or cut.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> For readability purposes, these rules use standard English grammar when referring to persons of uncertain gender: i.e., masculine pronouns. In such cases, these pronouns are intended to convey the meanings: she/he, his/her, etc.

</ul>
<h2>The Spell</h2>
<h3>Description Key</h3>
<p>Several types of codes may follow the spell names in the listings: area of effect, duration, range, and type. In addition, some descriptions will explain that a particular spell has a Resistance Roll Modification (shown with the notation <dfn>[RR Mod: #]</dfn>). This section presents a key to those codes.</p>

<h4>SPECIAL SPELL CODES</h4>
<p><strong>[RR Mod: <em>#</em>]</strong> — Any RRs against the effects of this spell are modified by <em>#</em>.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> — Instantaneous; spell doesn’t require preparation</p>
<p><strong>&bull;</strong> — spell doesn’t require power points</p>
<p><strong>&Dagger;</strong> — Part of a set of spells that must be thrown continuously in order to be effective (or fully effective)</p>
<h4>SPELL TYPES</h4>
<p><strong>E</strong> — Elemental spell. These spells use the force of the spell to manipulate physical elements (heat, cold, wind, light, water, earth, sound, smell, taste, touch). These elements (and not the spell) are used to either create a phenomena that can affect the physical environment of the target (e.g., a “wall” spell) <strong>or</strong> the sense of the target (e.g., an “illusion” spell). Because the elements are real, no Resistance Rolls are normally allowed.</p>
<p><strong>BE</strong> — Ball Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that attack an area with one of the physical elements. (i.e., “ball” spells). Such attacks are resolved on either <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.2">Attack Table 5.2</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.3">Attack Table 5.3</a>.</p>
<p><strong>DE</strong> — Directed Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that directly attack a target with one of the physical elements (i.e., “bolt” spells). Such attacks are resolved on one of the “bolt” attack tables (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.4">Attack Tables 5.4</a> through <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.8">5.8</a>).</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> — Force spell. These spells involve the direct manipulation of matter, energy, the elements, or living beings through the use of a spell’s force. If the spell has a target capable of resisting, the caster must make an attack roll on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.1">Basic Spell Attack Table 5.1</a> to determine the RR modification for the target. Determine the type of armor the target is wearing and roll on the appropriate column of the table (using the Other column if nothing else applies). After determining the RR modification, the target makes an RR (on <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_5.10">Table 5.10</a>, using the target’s level and the attacker’s level as the indexes).</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> — Passive spell. These spells usually only indirectly or passively affect a target. Thus, if an RR is allowed (GM’s discretion), its purpose is only to determin if the target is aware of the spell. Many detection spells are of this type.</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> — Utility spell. These spells only affect the caster, a willing target, or a target incapable of resistance. Thus, RRs are not usually necessary. A willing target who is capable of resisting may still be required to make an RR (GM’s discretion), but it is modified by -50 (i.e., he will most like not resist). Most healing spells are of this type.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> — Informational spell. These spells involve gathering information through means that do not require RRs.</p>
<h4>SPELL SUB-TYPES</h4>
<p><strong>s</strong> — Subconscious spell. These spells are capable of being cast (or triggered) by the subconscious. The caster can always cast a spell of this type as a normal spell; and if he is unconscious (or is asleep or in a trance), a spell of this type can be cast by the subconscious as necessary (starting with the highest level spell needed). An exception to this is the <em>Stun Relief</em> spell. This spell may (at the option of the caster) be cast by the subconscious while the caster is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong> — Mental Attack spell. These spells affect the target’s mind and are subject to mental defenses.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/OF CHANNELING" -->
<h1><a name="SL_2">2.0 </a><span id="channeling">OF CHANNELING</span></h1>
<p><span id="channeling">Channeling</span> represents the power of the deities of a given world as channeled through their followers or other spell users. It is spiritual and religious in nature. A spell user of this realm may draw his strength from his respective deity, and often does not require active cooperation of the deity; this is especially true where the spell user is employing relatively weak or subtle spells (e.g., healing spells, detecting spells, etc.). Thus, spells of this realm do not necessarily reflect the nature of specific deities. More powerful and significant spells, however, such as death spells and the revival of the dead, might require the active cooperation of a deity.<br />
In organic substances, notably metal, interfere with the drawing of power from the deities. Wearing metal helmets or armor, or carrying lots of metal results in riskier spell casting of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spells. For a full discussion of the modifiers for metal interfering with <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spells, see the <em>Rolemaster Standard System</em>.<br />
One other issue must be decided upon by the GM when allowing spells from this realm: Lifegiving. Lifegiving entails the reunification of a soul with a body capable of supporting it. It is not the healing of the system shock and damage; rather, it is the restoration of the spark of life itself. A physical body which is able to nurture the soul is always required before life can be restored. In addition, the GM may deem it necessary to require certain rituals or specific conduct before a lifegiving spell can be successful.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/OF ESSENCE" -->
<h1><a name="SL_3">3.0 </a><span id="essence">OF ESSENCE</span></h1>
<p>The <span id="essence">Essence</span> is that which is common to all things, living and dead, organic and inorganic. It has been characterized by many names—the Tao, Magic, the Unified Field, etc., and represents a force and order that defines the ways of the world. Changes in the patterns of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> dictate the flow of events, and the course of life itself. It is a power beyond the grasp of any being.<br />
Nonetheless, some who become one with the Essence find ways of manipulating its patterns on a temporary basis. This fleeting strength allows them to redefine the reality around them, molding elements and wielding very real power. Thus, the spells of those who are of the realm of <span id="essence">Essence</span> can be both beautiful and lethal, affecting one or many. In the end, however, the normal patterns will always prevail, and only the effects will remain to tell the tale.<br />
Those things unliving interfere with the manipulation of the patterns of the essence. Being essentially inert, they inhibit the usual extension of one’s own <span id="essence">Essence</span>, creating difficulty for the spell user seeking to alter patterns outside the body’s immediate sphere. This ability to mold the Essence is a prerequisite to successful casting of spells. It is because of this principle, that users of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> will rarely wear armor or helms while utilizing spells. Inorganic substances, particularly metal, create even greater difficulties (and provides stronger protection against the powers of Essence). For a full discussion of the modifiers for these object interfering with Essence spells, see the <em>Rolemaster Standard System</em>.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/OF MENTALISM" -->
<h1><a name="SL_4">4.0 </a><span id="mentalism">OF MENTALISM</span></h1>
<p>The mind is an amazing tool, especially for those who use it. Yet, no one uses it to its full capacity. <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> is that realm of power in which the masters of spells strive to use their minds in ways few even contemplate. By using the very personal power locked within themselves, Mentalism users are able to channel the power of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> through their own mental corridors; thus, manipulating and bending the reality that surrounds them. In a sense, they act as very minute imitations of the deities above, giving power not to clerics, but retaining it and directing its manipulation. <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> users are masters of the Essence within themselves.<br />
Because <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> users are not deities, however, they work within the limitations of their worldly bodies, their own senses, and perceptions. Rarely are they able to direct their spells beyond themselves or one target. Manipulation of one’s own <span id="essence">Essence</span> does not yield the widereaching power of the other realms. Additionally, the physical freedom of the <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> user’s head is prerequisite to the use of this inner strength (any head covering inhibits casting of spells from this realm). For a full discussion of the modifiers for head covering interfering with <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> spells, see the <em>Rolemaster Standard System</em>.<br />
Nonetheless, the power of the <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> user can reach great heights. They are masters of thought, gatherers of presence and inner strength. Even though their focus is generally limited to singular targets, their abilities regarding personal confrontations are considerable indeed ... for, it is the <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> user who seeks to fulfill the destiny of his own mind.</p>

<h1><a name="SL_5">5.0 </a>Spell Attack Tables</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This section contains this introduction, a key to all of the tables in this section, 8 spell attack tables, and 1 resistance roll table. Each page will contain a single attack table. On the back of each table will be one or two critical tables (or in one case, tables of modifiers for special circumstances). In addition, at the bottom of each table there is other pertinent information for the special attack (including which critical tables are used with the attack).</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If you are not using <strong>Rolemaster (RM)</strong>, you should examine all of the Appendices for notes on how to use these tables effectively.
</blockquote>
<h2>How to Use These Tables</h2>
<p>There are three different types of attack tables in this section. There are two tables (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.2">5.2</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#5.3">5.3</a>) that are used for area attack spells (Cold Ball and Fireball). There are five different types of directed (targeted) spell attacks (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_5.4">5.4</a> through <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_5.8">5.8</a>—including Lightning Bolt, Fire Bolt, etc.). The other table (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_5.1">5.1</a>) is used for all other types of attack spells (i.e., spells that require any RRs by the target).<br />
To resolve an area attack spell, the caster must roll an attack roll (not open-ended). If the original roll is 01 to 04, the spell has failed and the attacker must roll on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.6">Spell Failure Table 6.6</a>. If the original roll is between 96 and 00, the spell is practically perfect and the results from the table are applied (cross-indexing the roll with the target’s AT). On any other result, the attacker applies the modifications shown on the attack table and in <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.9">Table 5.9</a> and cross-indexes the modified roll (with a maximum result of 95) with the target’s AT.<br />
To resolve a directed (targetted) attack, the attacker must roll an attack roll (open-ended high). If the attack roll (before modifications) is a 01 or 02, the attacker must roll again on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.6">Spell Fumble Table 6.6</a>. If the attack roll (before modifications) is 00, the perfect spell has been cast and the results from the table are applied (cross-indexing 00 with the target’s AT). On any other result, the attacker applies the modifications shown on the attack table and in <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.9">Table 5.9</a> and cross-indexes the modified roll with the target’s AT.<br />
To resolve all other types of attack spells, the caster should roll d100 (not open-ended). If the result is a 01 or 02, the attack has failed and the caster must roll again on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_6.6">Spell Fumble Table 6.6</a>. If the attack is between 96 and 00, the nearly perfect spell has been cast (use the results from the table). On any other result, apply the modifications shown on <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.1">Table 5.1</a>, and cross-index the modified roll with the appropriate column. The table is divided into three sections (one for each realm of casting); use the section that applies to the realm of the caster. For hybrid spells, use the column that is least advantageous (as indicated by the failure range). Each section has three columns, use the column that applies to the target’s armor.<br />
To use the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.10">Resistance Roll Table (5.10)</a>, cross-index the attacker’s level with the target’s level. This is the number that the target must equal or exceed to resist the effects of the spell. In some cases, the attack level is the level of the spell (this is usually true only with spells stored in items). There are usually modifications to the RR (as shown on the table).</p>
<h2>Reading the Tables</h2>
<p>There are two different types of results that can be generated from these tables. One type is generated from the elemental attack tables; a different type is generated from the Basic Attack Table.<br />
There are four possible results on the elemental attack tables: a failure (i.e., “F”), a miss (i.e., “–”), a normal hit (e.g., “3”), or a critical hit (e.g., “5B”). If the result is a failure, the attacker should roll on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.6">Spell Failure Table 6.6</a>. If the result is a miss, the attack does no damage. If the result is a simple hit, apply the number in the table as concussion damage to the defender. If the result is a critical hit, apply the number portion of the result as concussion damage and roll a second roll on the indicated critical table and column. Which critical chart to use will be indicated a the bottom of the attack table.<br />
The Basic Attack Table works differently. There are only two different types of results on the table: a failure (i.e., “F”) or success (i.e., +20 or -15). If the result is a failure, the attacker should roll on the Spell Failure Table 6.6. If the spell succeeds, the resulting number will be used as a modification to the target’s Resistance Roll.</p>
<h2>Defining The Attack</h2>
<p>These tables cover four different types of spell attacks and resolution. The directed (targetted) spell attacks should use their appropriate table (e.g., a Fire Bolt should use the Fire Bolt Attack Table). The area attack spells should use the most their appropriate tables (e.g., a Cold Ball should use the Cold Ball Attack Table). Any spell that requires the target to make an RR, should use the Basic Attack Table (e.g., a Sleep spell, a Charm Kind spell, etc.).</p>
<h2>Key to the Tables</h2>
<p>Some attack tables can generate critical results better than an 'E'. When this occurs, a note at the bottom of the table will direct you on how to handle the critical result.<br />
If two criticals are delivered from the same attack, always roll one number and look up the same number in two different columns on the critical chart(s).</p>

<h1><a name="SL_6">6.0 </a>Critical & Failure Tables</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This section contains this introduction, a key to all of the tables in this section, 5 critical tables, and 1 failure table. In addition, at the bottom of each table there is a key for all of the special symbols used in the table.</p>
<h2>How to Use These Tables</h2>
<p>To resolve most critical hits, roll d100 (not open-ended) and cross-index the result on the appropriate column of the chart.<br />
The exception to this method are the large and super large critical tables. When attacking a target that is classified as “large” or “super large,” you must ascertain whether the attack deals normal damage or slaying damage. Cross-index a high open-ended d100 roll with the type of damage dealt.<br />
To resolve a failure, simply roll a d100 (not open-ended) and cross-index the result with the type of spell attack that generated the failure. Each column on the table corresponds to a type (or types) of spells. Use the column that corresponds the type of spell being cast.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If you are not using <strong>Rolemaster (RM)</strong>, you should examine all of the Appendices for notes on how to use these tables effectively.
</blockquote><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Maal Kylor is in the middle of a combat with a black bear. He attacks with a Fire Bolt spell (using the Fire Bolt attack table).<br />
During the first round of combat, Maal rolls a 02, a fumble! He rolls again, resulting in a 49. He looks up a 49 on the Elemental column and sees that he loses the spell and the power points.
</blockquote>
<h2>Slaying Attacks</h2>
<p>Certain types of spell attacks may be deemed as “slaying” against specific types of creatures. For example, a Vacuum spell cast upon an elemental creature of air, is treated as slaying. If you are using a “slaying” attack against a target that is not large or super large, you should resolve the attack normally. However, if the normal attack delivers a critical, the weapon will deliver an additional critical. Cross-index the roll used to resolve the normal critical on the Slaying column of the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.5">Creature Critical Strike Table 6.5</a>.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Mike, playing Kohrist the Magician, casts a Vacuum I on an Elemental Servant. The description of the spell reads that anyone in the area of effect suffers an 'A' Impact critical.<br />
His normal critical roll is a 96! He resolves the normal critical and then he rolls again (because 96 is open-ended), getting an 11; for a total of 107. He looks up 107 on the Slaying column of the Large Creature Critical Strike Table 6.5.
</blockquote>
<h2>Key to the Tables</h2>
<p>All of the tables in this section have two different types of information: descriptions and mechanics.</p>
<ul>
<li>The description information will describe the critical hit (usually including a body location). The GM should feel free to alter the description to more appropriately fit the type of attack.</li>
<li>The mechanics information is the game effects of the critical hit. The GM should rarely alter these results. The presentation of this information will always follow this format:
<blockquote>
+ßH – ß∑– ß∏– ß∫ – ß(-α) – ß(+α)
</blockquote>
where α and ß are numbers. In general:
<blockquote>
H = hits<br />
∑ = rounds of stun<br />
∏ = rounds of no parry<br />
π = rounds of must parry<br />
∫ = hits per round<br />
(-α) = penalt<br />
(+α) = bonus<br />
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, the second and third items are combined (reading as ∑∏). Also, sometimes the third item is replaced with ß(π -α) (there can never be both a ∏ and a π entry). Below is a more detailed explanation of the entries.</p>
<ul>
<li>+ßH – This indicates that the target of the attack takes an additional ß hits of damage.</li>
<li>ß∑ – This indicates that the target of the attack is stunned for ß rounds. While stunned, the target may only parry with half his normal ability; the only other allowed actions are maneuvering (modified by at least -50). When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li>ß∏: This indicates that the target of the attack cannot parry for ß rounds. The only allowable actions are maneuvering (modified by at least -75). This result is often accompanied by a ∑ result (see above). When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li>ß(π -α): This indicates that the target of the attack must parry for his next ß actions with a penalty of α. When α is not specified, it is assumed to be zero.</li>
<li>ß∫: This indicates that the target of the attack will loose ß hits every round until the wound is healed. "Bleeding" represents not only actual blood loss, but also represents ongoing pain. When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li>ß(-α): This indicates the target of the attack suffers a penalty of α for ß rounds. When ß is not specified, the penalty is assumed to last until wound is healed.</li>
<li>ß(+α): This indicates that the attacker gains a bonus of α for ß rounds. When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>

<h1><a name="SL_7">7.0 </a>Spell List Notes</h1>
<h2><a name="SL_7.1">7.1 </a>SPECIAL NOTES</h2>
<p>Remember, that the spells described in <em>Spell Law</em> do not comprise the entirety of a world’s legacy. There may be an infinite variety yet to be discovered. <em>Spell Law</em> provides a world with spells found in common usage and/or knowledge (from a relative standpoint). These spells provide a framework based on the normal needs of an environment, and may act as standards by which Gamemasters can judge other creations or discoveries.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.1">7.1.1 </a>Subconscious Spells</h3>
<p>A <em>Stun Relief</em> spell may be cast normally while stunned (or stunned no parry) with no penalty. Similarly, an <em>Awake</em> spell may be cast while unconscious or asleep if circumstances alert the caster/spell’s senses. In both cases, it is assumed that the spell is triggered subconsciously.<br />
Similarly, any subconscious spell can be triggered while the caster is unconscious, asleep, in a trance, etc. A subconsciou spell can be triggered by conditions that the spell can affect (e.g., a <em>Regenerate</em> spell will trigger if the caster is knocked out and has unhealed concussion hits).<br />
Alternatively, a GM may allow a character to set conditions on his subconscious spells by "programming" his subconscious (e.g., a character might decide to only trigger <em>Regenerate</em> if he takes hits and goes unconscious in combat and not if he just trips and falls and knocks himself out). In such a case, the GM may require a maneuver roll to use the "programming" modified by +50 <em>plus</em> three times the character's Self Discipline <em>plus</em> any skill developed in this area.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.2">7.1.2 </a>Spell Versions</h3>
<p>Spells having the same name, but occurring on different lists, are necessarily similar; they may be found at different levels (depending on their relationship to the source of power), and often have differing effects.<br />
Always remember that spell descriptions should be read in context with the other spells on the same list. If an upper level spell of the same name specifies a certain effect, the lower level version will necessarily have a lesser effect.<br />
Many of the spells from previous versions of Spell Law have been renamed with a numerical progression (e.g., the Fly spells become <em>Fly I</em>, <em>Fly III</em>, <em>Fly V</em>, etc.) to reflect their basic similarity. These spells should be considered the same spell but for the enhancements unique to each. This means, for instance, that two spells of the same name may not be cast upon a target simultaneously.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.3">7.1.3 </a>Good, Evil, Dark &amp; Light</h3>
<p>There are a number of “alignment”-oriented spells in Spell Law. Largely, the application of these spells depends upon the system of morals the GM is using within his world. For these purposes, <strong>Good</strong> is assumed to be primarily motivated to promote the well-being and happiness of others, or to combat those forces that stand against it (i.e., Evil). <strong>Evil</strong> is characterized as that which causes intentional suffering or destruction, and that which strives to overthrow good. These definitions may (and should) be altered to fit the GM’s particular view of these concepts.</p>
<p><strong>“Of Light”</strong> is defined as something of “Good” origins (regardless of whether the thing itself is Good or not).</p>
<p><strong>“Of Darkness”</strong> is defined as something of “Evil” origins (regardless of whether the thing itself is Evil or not).</p>
<p><strong>“Holy”</strong> is defined as a person, place or object magically blessed by any priest or servant of a deity (or even the deityitself). Note that this may also include the concept of “Unholy,” if Holy is applied to a Good blessing and Unholy applied to an Evil blessing.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.4">7.1.4 </a>Repeated Spell Attempts</h3>
<p>When a spell caster attempts certain magical effects (e.g., <em>Item Analysis</em>, <em>Remove Curse</em>, etc.), that caster may attempt such an action on a specific item or situation only once per experience level. If the attempt fails, another attempt may not be made until another level of experience has been attained.<br />
Alternately, the GM may determine that another attempt may be made only after the caster has developed another skill rank for the list on which the spell is located.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.5">7.1.5 </a>Variability of Spell Duration</h3>
<p>If a spell caster has some means of tracking time precisely, it is possible to know exactly how long a given spell will last. Most casters do not have such means, however, and should not be allowed to know exactly when a given duration is going to elapse. The GM may roll randomly to give a ±10-20% variability to the duration, or any other range the GM desires. This reflects the typical inability of one to accurately judge the precise passage of time.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A Magician casts a Fly spell that has a duration of 12 minutes. The player, having calculated out the distance to the far shore of a large inland lake, begins his flight. The GM rolls a 10% reduction in duration, and the player is going to be very surprised when he plunges into the lake unexpectedly.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.6">7.1.6 </a>Permanent Spells</h3>
<p>A number of spells have a permanent duration. Typically, these spells deal with the creation of objects, substances, or effects. These durations are intended to indicate that a real, tangible object, substance, or effect has been produced. These results (unless otherwise noted) are subject to the normal effects of time and the environment. For instance, a Wall of Ice is permanent in duration, but is still subject to melting or destruction. The same is true of healing spells; a wound might be healed, but the target is still subject to such wounds in future.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.7">7.1.7 </a>Resistance rolls for Area Effects</h3>
<p>Normally, radius effect spells do not allow a RR to avoid the attack or effect. However, if a caster tries to place the centerpoint of an radius effect on a target, the target receives a RR, with success indicating that the effect will be centered upon the target's location at the time of the casting, and not upon the target himself. Note that this does not negate the effect, but prevents the effect from being “attached” to the target.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.8">7.1.8 </a>Bard Spells</h3>
<p>The Bard spell lists use singing as the delivery method for the spell effects (e.g., <em>Song of Mastery</em>, <em>Great Song</em>, etc.). At the GM’s discretion, the Bard may use whatever delivery desired (e.g., musical instrument, oratory, dance, etc.) to produce the same results.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.9">7.1.9 </a>Herb &amp; Plant Spells</h3>
<p><em>Herb Enhancement</em> and <em>Herb Mastery</em> spells increase the potency (e.g., 2x, 3x, etc.) of herbs; this normally increases the effects of a dose of the herb (e.g., 2x potency for a “Heal 1-10” herb would give a “Heal 2-20” herb). However, a GM may wish to have these spells increase the number of doses of an herb (i.e., 2x potency cast on 2 doses of a “Heal 1-10” herb would result in 4 doses). In either case, only one of these spells may be cast upon a specific herb. <em>Plant growth</em> spells do not work on herbs.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.10">7.1.10 </a>Invisibility</h3>
<p>Only objects/beings totally contained in an invisibility radius at the time of casting become invisible; such an object/being would become visible upon totally leaving the radius; such an object/being would become visible upon violating the normal <em>Unseen/Invisibility</em> restrictions (e.g., attacking, receiving a violent blow, etc.), but the other objects/beings associated with the radius would remain invisible.<br />
Two or more invisible beings in a radius of invisibility must make “coordination” rolls to attempt to move together; difficulty would be based upon the amount of communication (e.g., holding hands – routine; touching – easy; talking to one another – Medium; etc.).<br />
Any solid material that enters an invisibility radius after casting will produce a “fringe effect” (i.e., will blur slightly, will seem slightly out of focus); potential observers may make a Perception roll to see if they notice the effects of the invisibility. If an observer is alert, suggested difficulties are:</p>
<p><em>Absurd</em> — one being walking with a 1" radius about his person;</p>
<p><em>Sheer Folly</em> — one being moving at faster than a walking pace with a 1" radius;</p>
<p><em>Extremely Hard</em> — one being walking with a 1' radius about his person;</p>
<p><em>Very Hard</em> — one being moving at faster than a walking pace with a 1' radius;</p>
<p><em>Hard</em> — a 10'R or larger moving at a walking pace; Medium — a 10'R or larger moving at faster than a walking pace.</p>
<p>If the invisibility is not moving there is an additional modification of -20. If the observer is within 10' of the fringe effect there is an additional modification of +20.<br />
Attacks against invisible targets are modified by at least -50, unless the attacker can <em>See Invisible</em>. However, the invisible target must be detected in some way before an attack can even be attempted (via the fringe effect, <em>Detect Invisible</em>, some disturbance, mental detection, etc.).<br />
Invisibility is a very useful and powerful type of spell. This type of spell normally lasts 24 hours or until the target attacks or until the target is struck by a violent blow. Often an invisible character (or creature) attempting a moving maneuver has a chance of bumping into something or taking a jarring blow due to stumbling or landing. In such a case after the maneuver roll, we suggest that a roll be made and that the character becomes visible if the result is less than or equal to a certain value based upon the difficulty of the maneuver. The suggested values are: <em>Routine</em> (no roll), <em>Easy</em> (02), <em>Light</em> (05), <em>Medium</em> (10), <em>Hard</em> (15), <em>Very Hard</em> (20), <em>Extremely Hard</em> (25), <em>Sheer Folly</em> (40), <em>Absurd</em> (50). Of course if the character “falls” or “falls down” due to the result of the moving maneuver, he becomes visible. If the result is “fail to act” or “freeze”, no visibility roll is required.
<h4>SPECIAL EFFECTS ON INVISIBILITY</h4>
<p>Certain factors may improve perception rolls made to detect invisible objects or beings.</p>
<p><strong>Rain/Water—</strong>Rain or water rushing on and over the area of effect of an invisibility spell will improve the chances of perceiving an invisible area through the heightened “fringe effect” of the rain passing through the radius limit. Modifications to any Perception rolls shift the difficulty of the maneuver by 2 to 3 “columns,” depending on the amount of water, size of the invisibility radius and lighting.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Wifflebatt the Mad is trying to escape from his arch-nemesis, Luiss Vill the Slugar, by turning invisible and sneaking past him. Unfortunately, it is raining heavily, and what would ordinarily be an Extremely Hard maneuver for Luiss becomes a Medium maneuver instead.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dust/Powder/Paint—</strong>Any substance that will coat an object will do so normally with an invisible object. An invisible being covered in flour, for instance, would be visible as a white figure, allowing normal perception. Bonuses for perceiving an invisible object or being coated in this fashion range involve a “column shift” of 4 to 6 degrees of difficulty, depending upon the degree of coverage and the ease of seeing the covering substance itself (e.g., coal dust covering an invisible being at night will not help as much as crimson paint during the day on a snowfield). Additionally, the fringe effect of a substance passing through the invisibility radius will produce a fringe effect as with rain/water above.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.11">7.1.11 </a>“Changing” Spells</h3>
<p>Spells which transform the caster or target into other creatures (or even plants) must be handled with caution. The lower level changing spells only give the physical form, without the commensurate abilities or powers. It is simply as if the recipient of the spell had altered his body to <em>appear</em> like the desired creature. Combat abilities, flying abilities, or any other special aspect are not received.<br />
If a “changing” spell indicates that physical abilities <em>are</em> received, then purely physical abilities may be utilized, such as armor type, flight, and the use of natural weaponry (no skill with these abilities are received, but the caster may develop such skills). No magical or special abilities are received (e.g., breath weapons, magical immunities, spell capabilities, etc.). These abilities are only received if the spell <em>explicitly</em> states that such abilities are possible.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.12">7.1.12 </a>Encumbrance Limits For Movement Spells</h3>
<p>When dealing with movement spell (e.g., <em>Fly</em>, <em>Levitation</em>, <em>Leaving</em>, <em>Long Door</em>, etc.), we suggest that such spells normally handle a base weight up to 1.5 times the target’s mass (weight). For every level of the caster, an additional 5 lbs is added to this base amount. There is then a 1% chance per 10 lbs over this limit that the spell will fail whenever the target attempts to lift more than the base amount. For example, a 200 lb 10th level Magician normally could <em>Levitate</em> up to 350 lb (200lb x 1.5 + 50lb= 350lb base). If the Magician attempted to lift 400 lbs, the chance of the spell failing would be only 5%. This chance occurs each and every time the caster attempts to lift additional weight, although weight may be discarded without danger. This chance of failure is handled separately from (and in addition to) normal spell failure.<br />
Note that the target's own weight is included in these calculations.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.13">7.1.13 </a>Wall Spells and Material Integrity</h3>
<p>Any “wall” created by a spell must rest on a solid surface when initially created. It cannot be created in the same space as other solid material—it can only displace liquids and gases. With all such walls, the caster has the option of varying the width and height (not the thickness) up to the allowed dimensions of the spell. If the caster attempts to “fill” a space with a wall, the wall will not fit perfectly (i.e., not snuggly).<br />
The “wall” spells produce a variety of solid structures as barriers, made up of various materials. In order to destroy such a structure, hits must be delivered to it by an object or weapon (or spell) harder than the structure’s substance. Each concussion hit delivered in this fashion is applied towards the <strong>Structural Hits</strong> of the structure.<br />
The total <strong>Structural Hits</strong> of any structure is determined by consulting the following chart and multiplying the hits per cubic foot (cu') by the total volume of the structure (cu" = cubic inches, cu' = cubic feet, sq" = square inches, sq' = square feet).</p>
<h4>COMMON BRICK</h4>
<blockquote>
Dimensions: 3" x 8" x 4"<br />
Volume = 3" x 8" x 4" = 96 cu"<br />
Material: Brick — AT-13 — Base Hits at 36 cu" = 60 <br />
Total Hits = (96 cu"  ̃ 36 cu") x 60 = 160
</blockquote>
<h4>DOOR, EXTERIOR WOODEN</h4>
<blockquote>
Dimensions: 1" x 6'(72") x 3.5'(42")<br />
Volume = 1" x 72" x42" = 3024cu"<br />
Material: Oak — AT-9 — Base Hits at 36 cu" = 35 <br />
Total Hits = (3024 cu"  ̃ 36 cu") x 35 = 2940
</blockquote>
<h4>DOOR, INTERIOR WOODEN</h4>
<blockquote>
Dimensions: 3/4" x 6'(72") x 3'(36")<br />
Volume = 0.75" x 72" x 36" = 1944 cu"<br />
Material: Pine — AT-8 — Base Hits at 36 cu" = 30 <br />
Total Hits = (1944 cu"  ̃ 36 cu") x 30 = 1620
</blockquote>
<h4>DOOR, VAULT (MODERN)</h4>
<blockquote>
Dimensions: 3' x 4' x 4'<br />
Volume = 3' x 4' x 4' = 48 cu'<br />
Material: High Steel — AT-19 — Base hits at 1cu' = 24,000<br />
Total Hits = (48 cu'  ̃ 1 cu') x 24,000 = 1,152,000
</blockquote>
<h4>TREE TRUNK</h4>
<blockquote>
Dimensions: 30' high with a radius of 1'<br />
Volume = 3.142 x (1 sq') x 30' = 94.26 cu' <br />
Material: Oak — AT-9 — Base Hits at 1 sq' = 1680 <br />
Total hits = (94.26 cu' x 1 cu') x 1680 = 158,356
</blockquote>
<h4>SIMPLE IRON LOCK</h4>
<blockquote>
Dimensions: 0.5" x 3" x 3"<br />
Volume = 0.5" x 3" x 3" = 4.5 cu"<br />
Material: Iron — AT-18 — Base Hits at 36 cu" = 200 <br />
Total Hits = (4.5 cu"  ̃ 36 cu") x 200 = 25
</blockquote>
<h4>WALL OF STONE (AS PER SPELL)</h4>
<blockquote>
Dimensions: 10' x 10' x 1'<br />
Volume = 10' x 10' x 1' = 100 cu'<br />
Material: Stone — AT-12 — Base Hits at 1 cu' = 2400 <br />
Total Hits = (100 cu'  ̃ 1 cu') x 2400 = 240,000
</blockquote>
<h4>BREACHING</h4>
<p>It is not usually necessary to destroy an entire structure to render it ineffective as a barrier. Simply destroy enough of the structure to pass whatever it is that needs to cross the barrier (e.g., a man-sized hole is 3' x 3' x thickness of structure). Determine the volume of that breach and consult the table above, then add an additional 15% to overcome the natural reinforcement of the surrounding structure. Once this area has had enough hits to destroy it, the barrier is breached.</p>
<h4>CRITICAL HITS</h4>
<p>Whenever a critical is delivered to a structure, additional hits are delivered to the structure based on the following chart:</p>
<h4>SPECIAL SPELL EFFECTS</h4>
<p>There are a number of spells dealing with solid manipulation, disruption and destruction (e.g., <em>Powder Stone</em>, <em>Earth to Dust</em>, <em>Disintegration</em>, etc.). These spells are intuitive for the most part, and structural hits need not be calculated if the spell simply destroys/alters the substance.</p>
<h4>CRACKS CALL</h4>
<p><em>Cracks Call</em> is handled slightly differently. Any natural or man-made structure can be assumed to have minute or microscopic cracks inherent in the structure. <em>Cracks Call</em> extends and enlarges those cracks without destroying the structure, weakening it without bringing it down. Any further damage to such a structure does increased damage, reflected by tripling any further damage.</p>
<h4>WEAPON BREAKAGE</h4>
<p>Pounding on a wall with a weapon is not conducive to the future efficacy of the weapon. In general, whenever striking a hard, immobile substance like a wall, weapon breakage should be checked every swing.</p>
<p><strong>Concussion Weapons—</strong>Weapons such as hammers, maces and mattocks are well-suited to this kind of work, and are only susceptible to normal breakage. Whenever a check is made, assess a -10 modification to the roll.</p>
<p><strong>Slashing Weapons—</strong>Weapons such as swords and axes are not as well suited to this work, and each weapon breakage check is modified by -35. In addition, every strike generates a chance equal to the number of concussion hits dealt that permanent damage will be done to the weapon, and it will be at -5 thereafter until it can be reworked in a smithy. If a weapon ever drops below -25 in this fashion, it is useless as an edged weapon. (A lenient GM may rule that a battleaxe may reduce itself to a light flanged mace in this fashion.)</p>
<h4>FUMBLES</h4>
<p>Weapon fumbles automatically require weapon breakage checks, and do negligible damage to any structure they are attacking.</p>
<h4>SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT</h4>
<p>Certain special equipment is especially effective against certain materials. Axes and chisels on wood, and picks, mattocks and stone chisels against stone and earth fall into this category. If the GM deems that a particular weapon is particularly well suited to such work, they should be assigned a bonus of between +25 and +50, with a +10 modification to all breakage rolls.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.14">7.1.14 </a>Canceling a Spell</h3>
<p>The caster of a non-permanent spell can, at any time, cancel that spell; the caster must be within the spell’s original range limit or within “sensing” range of the spell’s current effects. The caster cannot cancel the actual physical or mental results of a spell (e.g., fire, wounds, etc.). Cancellation takes 1 round of concentration.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.15">7.1.15 </a>Combining Spell Effects</h3>
<p>The effects of spells of the same name cannot normally be combined (e.g., the effects of a <em>Protection I</em> spell and a <em>Protection II</em> spell cannot be combined).<br />
The various <em>Aura</em> spells may not be combined with Blur.<br />
A Gamemaster may not want to allow certain other spells to be combined. If it is more appropriate in his world system, we strongly suggest he make more restrictions than we indicate in the rules. This may be particularly appropriate for spells on the same list (e.g., the Cleric Base list, Protections).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A GM might not allow Prayer I (+5 to RRs and maneuvers) and Resistance I (+5 to RRs and DB) to combine for the purposes of RRs.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.16">7.1.16 </a>Spells Against Multiple Targets</h3>
<p>When casting a spell that can affect multiple targets, the caster can concentrate in order to hold the spell until it can be applied to the allowed number of targets. For instance, a spell user casting <em>Deflections III</em> may be held until three missles have been fired at the caster and deflected.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.17">7.1.17 </a>Conflicting Spell Effects</h3>
<p>When two conflicting spells are directed at the same area, the lower level spell (or either one of two spells with equal levels) must make a RR; the attack level is the higher of the two levels and the target level is the lower of the two. If the RR fails, the lower level spell is canceled; if it succeeds, the higher level spell is canceled.<br />
Where more than two conflicting spells are involved, start with the lowest attack level spell and roll a RR versus the highest level spell. Repeat this process until only one spell is left.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.18">7.1.18 </a>Resistance Rolls for Passive Spells</h3>
<p>Spells listed as Passive in type do not provide a resistance roll to resist the effects of the spell. However, they do allow a resistance roll for the target to notice the spell.</p>
<h4>SPELL USERS</h4>
<p>Anyone who makes a successful RR versus a passive spell is aware that a spell has been cast on him. An open-ended roll may then be made, adding the appropriate Magical Lore skill bonus. If the modified result is over 100, then the spell can be identified by the target.</p>
<blockquote id="option">
<strong>Option 1:</strong> GMs may decide to give a bonus to the Magical Lore roll according to the success of the original RR. The following chart shows a suitable progression of bonuses:
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>RR made by</th><td>Bonus to Magical Lore Roll </td></tr>
<tr><td>01-10</td><td>+0</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-25 </td><td>+10</td></tr>
<tr><td>26-50 </td><td>+20</td></tr>
<tr><td>51+</td><td>+30</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote><blockquote id="option">
<strong>Option 2:</strong> Non spell users ordinarily have little or familiarity with magic and spells, and may not recognize the nature of a spell. When a non spell user makes a RR against a passive spell, the GM may inform the character of a strange feeling of some kind, i.e., the feeling of being watched, a strange tingling, hairs standing on end or goosebumps, etc. With great experience and/or familiarity, a non spell user may learn to recognize the feeling as a magical intrusion, and be able to react accordingly.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.19">7.1.19 </a>Visibility</h3>
<h4>FOG AND MIST</h4>
<p>Fog reduces visibility within its radius, depending upon its thickness. A light fog reduces all vision perception rolls by -15, and limits line of sight to approximately 100 feet. A heavy fog reduces all vision perception rolls by -50, and limits line of sight to approximately 10-20 feet. In addition, auditory perception checks are modified by -20, due to the inability to localize sounds effectively. A mist is treated as a light fog.</p>
<h4>NIGHTVISION</h4>
<p><em>Nightvision</em> allows an individual to see in the presence of extremely faint light. The light from the moon or stars or even a tiny point source of light is enough to allow a person with Nightvision to see normally. If there is <strong>no</strong> light (i.e., underground, in magical darkness, etc.), then <em>Nightvision</em> does not give any benefit.<br />
In addition, the use of <em>Nightvision</em> makes a person highly susceptible to sudden bright light. A very bright flash of light can stun an individual using <em>Nightvision</em>, giving a -50 modification to <em>Sudden Light</em> and similar spells.<br />
<em>Nightvision</em> suffers normal penalties to visibility due to fog, mist, etc.</p>
<h4>DARKVISION</h4>
<p><em>Darkvision</em> is a magical vision that allows the user to see in complete (including magical) darkness as if in normal daylight. The user is subject to the same penalties for bright light and fog as Nightvision.<br />
Note that this is the only Vision spell that can operate normally in <em>Utterdark</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.20">7.1.20 </a>Darkness and Blindness</h3>
<p>For game purposes, blindness and complete darkness may be handled the same way. Magical darkness is, to all intents and purposes, impenetrable without magical light of some kind. Normal fires, torches and the like will still produce heat, and will continue to burn (and ignite combustible materials), but will not produce any light.<br />
Characters who are blind or operating under magical darkness operate with a modification of -100. Characters with <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Spatial_Location_Awareness">Spatial Awareness</a> skill may attempt to move without penalty (or a reduced penalty).</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.21">7.1.21 </a>Informational Spells</h3>
<p>The Basic Attack Roll for spells that impart information to a character should be rolled by the GM. Because a fumble will impart false information to the PC, the player should not know whether the roll was successful or not. As a rule of thumb, a mild failure should result in vague or slightly incorrect information, when any information is received at all. A severe failure should give misleading or even dangerously wrong information to the PC.<br />
The <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.6">Spell Fumble Table 6.6</a> indicates the results of an informational spell fumble.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.22">7.1.22 </a>Dreams and Symbology</h3>
<p><em>Dream</em> spells and other divination spells are a valuable part of some fantasy environments, but some GMs are not comfortable with them. They represent an “outside” source of information that can skew a carefully planned story.<br />
The GM may decide to be explicit in the information given, but it is recommended that any information be imparted through symbology and metaphor. Animals, music, smells, panoramas, and other elements may be used to convey general messages and vague clues to the information being sought.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Khale has decided to employ his Dream spell to discover whether he should travel to Golotha by ship or overland. That night he receives a dream of a sea-bird perched upon a piece of beached driftwood beneath a storming sky. Upon awaking, Khale realizes that he has received his dream, but it was not the decisive clue he was looking for, and has created more questions than it has answered. Grumbling about double-dealing GMs, he decides to purchase a horse and travel overland than risk the strange portents of the dream.
</blockquote>
<p>In the above example, the dream might have implied that the PC would be shipwrecked, or that the journey would be dangerous but successful. It might have also been a storming sky because of other events in the background of the PC, rather than a reference to the journey itself. This method provides a check upon the abuse of these seemingly omniscient spells.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.23">7.1.23 </a>Fatal Channeling Projections</h3>
<p>Some who seek the divine aid of deities call for the death of their enemies. And, when efficiency and spell are paramount, they may turn to the use of fatal Channeling projections.<br />
Fatal Channeling projections fall into 2 categories; they may (1) destroy the soul or life’s Essence of the target or (2) they may destroy all or part of the target’s body. The former group consists of those projections known as <em>Absolutions</em>, spells normally found in the higher reaches of power. The latter category embraces what are commonly called <em>Black Channels</em>.<br />
While <em>Absolutions</em> refer to specific spells of power, <em>Black Channels</em> tend to vary with culture. The niceties of ritual and form mark the only great cultural distinctions between the sources of <em>Absolution</em>. <em>Black Channels</em>, however, produce widely differing results, many based on the preferences of ancestral prejudice.<br />
The detailed effects of <em>Absolutions</em> are found in the Evil Cleric base list, <em>Dark Channels</em>. Specific aspects of <em>Black Channels</em> are also found on that list; nonetheless, most of the actual results of usage are dictated by cultural choice and spell variation. Thus, the chart below has been provided. Certain users of <em>Black Channels</em> may have a choice with regard to which type they use in a specific situation. Others will be bound by cultural/religious restrictions, and may use only one variation.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.24">7.1.24 </a>Haste and Speed Spells</h3>
<p>A person under the effects of a <em>Haste</em> or <em>Speed</em> spell will have 200% activity each round, but must still abide by the turn sequence restrictions. The effects are summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>Combat—</strong>Two melee or missile attacks may be made per round. All bleeding critical results applied to a Hasted individual are doubled, and rounds of stun, parry or no parry are applied at 2 per round.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Log the Orc has been hasted and has gleefully been attacking twice per round with his axe. Unfortunately, he takes a ‘D’ critical and receives 4 rounds of stun with no parry and a bleeding wound of 4/rnd. He will be stunned with no parry for 2 full rounds and will bleed for 16 hits in that time.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spells—</strong>Only one spell may be cast per round, no matter whether <em>Hasted</em> or not. In addition, all spells cast upon a hasted individual last their normal duration.</p>
<p><strong>Cumulative Haste/Speed—</strong>Only one <em>Haste</em> or <em>Speed</em> spell may be in effect on an individual at any given time. In addition, as <em>Speed</em> requires a 50% activity penalty after the spell effects end, casting a <em>Speed</em> or <em>Haste</em> spell at that point will only bring a person to normal activity, rather than extending the 200% activity time (50% x 2 = 100%).</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.25">7.1.25 </a>“Path” Spells</h3>
<p>The various “Path” spells (<em>Pathfinding</em>, <em>Path Lore</em>, etc.) share a common definition of “path.” A “Path,” for these purposes, is a road, track or way created or constructed for a purpose, and along which something travels or moves with at least moderate frequency. This may have been constructed by men, animals, or other means.<br />
In addition, the bounds of the path, for the purposes of these spells, should be between those points at which a <em>larger</em> path, population center (e.g., village, town, city, etc.), or dead end intersects the original. For instance, if the PC casts a <em>Path Lore</em> on a secondary road between the King’s Highway and the Imperial Road, those two larger “paths” will mark the endpoints of the path, even if the road extends beyond both.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.26">7.1.26 </a>Mind/Mental Attack spells</h3>
<p>Any spell marked with an ‘<dfn>m</dfn>’ is considered a mental atack spell, and is subject to effects and defenses that target mental or mind attacks. It should also be noted that these spells are ineffective against any creature or entity that does not have a “mind” per se (e.g., Undead, plants, politicians, etc.).</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.27">7.1.27 </a>Illusions</h3>
<p>For the purposes of the guidelines outlined in this section, “illusions” include all “Elemental Type” spells (see page 6) that create or manipulate a physical element preceived by one of the six senses used in <em>Spell Law</em>: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch (i.e., feel), and <em>Presence</em>. Such spells include: <em>Illusions</em>, <em>Phantasms</em>, <em>Mirages</em>, <em>Facades</em>, <em>Misfeels</em>, etc.<br />
The sense aspects (i.e., physical elements) of such spells are actually created. Because of this, all potential targets actually sense an illusion and Resistance Rolls are <em>not</em> made to “not sense an illusion.” For example, a <em>Light Mirage</em> spell will actually create an image that consists of the physical element, light (much like we create holograms in our world)—so anyone looking a <em>Light Mirage</em> will actually see the image.</p>
<h4>DISCOVERING AN ILLUSION</h4>
<p>A target can “discover” if what he is sensing is an illusion by:</p>
<ul>
<li> Using a sense that is not affected by the aspects of the illusion (e.g., touching a <em>Light Mirage</em>)</li>
<li> Deducing that it only an illusion (e.g., an illusion of a fish walking on land might be easily discovered)</li>
<li> Using an appropriate detection spell (e.g., <em>Detect Essence</em>, <em>Detect Illusion</em>, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>But even if one of these things happens, the target senses will still be affected by the illusion (e.g., he will still see a Light Mirage even if puts his hand through it).</p>
<blockquote id="option">
<strong>Option:</strong> A GM may require an open-ended d100 roll for each illusion to determine how accurately it is rendered by the spell. This roll would be modified by the caster's skill bonus for the list that the spell comes from and by a standard difficulty modification (i.e., +10 for Light, -10 for Hard, etc.) based on the intricacy and unusualness of the illusion.<br />
Then he can allow each target that senses the illusion to make a Perception roll to “discover” the illusion (see above). Such a Perception roll is modified by subtracting the caster's modified roll. For example, if a caster's modified roll for an illusion is +75, then all such Perception rolls would be modified by -75.
</blockquote>
<h4>FEEL ILLUSIONS</h4>
<p>If one of the senses in an illusion is “feel,” then the illusion feels real to a target's touch senses. Striking part of such an illusion will cause the “feel” part of the illusion to be cancelled, but the rest of the illusion will remain for the normal duration of the spell. An illusion can be given multiple “feel” senses by using options from an <em>Illusion #</em> spell or a <em>Phantasm #</em> spell—in this case, each blow to the illusion cancels one of the “feel” senses.<br />
A <em>Phantasm</em> with “feel” (as one of the senses used) can strike a blow against a target; the blow is the equivalent of a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Strikes_Degree_1">Rank I Martial Arts Strikes</a> attack (i.e., a bare fist attack) with an OB equal to the caster's directed spell skill for <em>Phantasm</em> attacks. If a <em>Phantasm</em> has been given multiple “feel” senses by using options from a Phantasm # spell, each attack cancels one of the “feel” senses.<br />
If a <em>Phantasm</em> has been given increased “size” by using options from a Phantasm # spell, the concussion hit damage from an attack is doubled for each option so used (e.g., if two options are used to increase the “size” to a 40'R, the attack's concussion hit damage is four times normal).<br />
Even though the damage caused by a <em>Phantasm's</em> strike is like a bare fist, the phantasm can seem to be striking with any weapon or attack (e.g., sword, Dragon claw, hoof, dagger, etc.).</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.28">7.1.28 </a>Spell List Availability</h3>
<p>A Gamemaster may wish to make certain spell lists harder to learn than others for a variety of reasons. This can be done by making certain lists unavailable in certain cultures, or very difficult or expensive to obtain access to.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Desert nomad Mentalists might have some trouble attempting to learn the Liquid Alteration list — not particularly common in their culture.
</blockquote>
<p>Another approach could be to make access to certain lists controlled by guilds or craft associations, who might jealousy guard their trade secrets from all but initiates. Some arts of magic (lists) might will be found only in rare, ancient tomes. There a variety of approaches to limiting the flow of magical knowledge, and the one used by any particular GM will be dependent upon his world system. However, there should always be certain lists that are more or less “common knowledge” for members of each profession; usually these will be the profession's Base Lists.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.29">7.1.29 </a>Locks and Traps</h3>
<p>Locks and traps (and other mechanisms) are rated according to their complexity, which combines the sophisitication of the device with the difficulty in unlocking/disarming it (or operating some other type of mechanism) That is, a device may be relatively simple in construction yet be extremely difficult to unlock/disarm (or operate).<br />
This difficulty modifier follows the standard progression of:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Modifier</th></tr>
<tr><td>Routine</td><td>+30</td></tr>
<tr><td>Easy</td><td>+20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Light</td><td>+10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hard</td><td>-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Very Hard</td><td>-20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Extremely Hard</td><td>-30</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sheer Folly</td><td>-50</td></tr>
<tr><td>Absurd</td><td>at least -70</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This modifier applies to any skill attempt to pick/unlock the device. If a spell (e.g., <em>Opening I</em>, <em>Disarm I</em>, etc) is used to attempt to pick/unlock a device, the chance of the spell successfully operating is modified by <strong>half</strong> of the modifier given above.<br />
Some suggested difficulty modifiers are given on the table below:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Device</th><th>Complexity</th></tr>
<tr><td>Simple Shackle Lock</td><td>Easy </td></tr>
<tr><td>Padlock</td><td>Medium to Hard </td></tr>
<tr><td>Tumbler Luck</td><td>Hard to Extremely Hard </td></tr>
<tr><td>Double Key Tumbler</td><td>Sheer Folly</td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Special tools or circumstances may further modify the Complexity. For instance, trying to pick a Tumbler lock with the point of a dagger would raise the complexity significantly.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.30">7.1.30 </a>Curses and Diseases</h3>
<p>Curse and disease spells are handled in a special manner with regards to dispelling and canceling. Such a spell is normally unaffected by normal <em>Cancel</em> and <em>Dispel</em> spells.<br />
Curse spells include all of the spells on the Curses list (<a href="#SL_2.8.1">Section 2.8.1</a>) and a few other scattered spells. One of these spells can only be dispelled by <em>Uncurse</em> or <em>Remove Curse</em> spells.<br />
Disease spells include all of the spells on the Diseases list (<a href="#SL_2.8.4">Section 2.8.4</a>) and a few other scattered spells. One of these spells can only be dispelled by <em>Undisease</em> or <em>Remove Disease</em> spells. Alternatively, certain diseases may be “healed” by using normal healing treatments or healing spells.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.31">7.1.31 </a>Demons and Other Entities</h3>
<p>The “Entities” referred to in the Entity Summons spell list (<a href="#SL_3.8.4">Section 3.8.4</a>) include Demons, Elementals, and any other extra-planar creatures that are appropriate to a GM’s world. <em>Creatures &amp; Monsters</em> provides full discussions and descriptions of a wide variety of Demons and Elementals. This section provides a brief outline of some of the properties of Entities for use with the spells on the Dark Contacts and Entity Summons spell lists.<br />
Entities are assumed to be beings of another plane who are brought into the caster’s plane through the use of an elemental force (usually one not of the Entity’s plane). Thus, the Entity and caster do not make RRs during the initial summons and contact. The Entity can only remain in the world (for more than 2 rounds) while under the influence of an <em>Entity Mastery</em> spell, a <em>Control Entity</em> spell, a <em>Demon Mastery</em> spell, or a <em>Control Demon</em> spell.<br />
For the purposes of the <em>Spell Law</em> spells, the 6 Types of Entities be classified as follows:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Level</th><th>Elemental Name</th></tr>
<tr><td>I </td><td>1-2</td><td>Elemental Servants</td></tr>
<tr><td>II </td><td>3-5</td><td>Weak Elementals</td></tr>
<tr><td>III </td><td>6-10</td><td>Guardian Elementals</td></tr>
<tr><td>IV </td><td>11-15</td><td>Strong Elementals</td></tr>
<tr><td>V </td><td>16-20</td><td>—</td></tr>
<tr><td>VI</td><td>21-40</td><td>—</td></tr>
<tr><td>Beyond the Pale</td><td>41-100+</td><td>—</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>DEMON SUMMONING</h4>
<p>When a Demon is “summoned” (see the Entity Summons list, <a href="#SL_3.8.4">Section 3.8.4</a>), it gradually materializes over the course of two rounds. If the Demon is not <em>Controlled</em> or <em>Mastered</em> (i.e., usually by one of the spells on the Entity Summons list) before the Demon materializes, make a d100 roll (open-ended) and add the Demon’s Type times 10. Use this roll to determine the effect that the caster suffers (no RR):</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Roll</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
<tr><td>≤ 20 </td><td>Roll on the attack column of the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.6">Spell Failure Table 6.6</a>, caster takes result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21-40</td><td>Caster takes an ‘A ’ Impact critical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41-60 </td><td>Caster takes a ‘B’ Impact critical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61-75</td><td>caster takes a ‘C’ Impact critical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76-90 </td><td>caster takes a ‘D’ Impact critical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91-100 </td><td>caster takes an ‘E’ Impact critical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;100</td><td>Demon gives caster a <em>Quest</em> (GM discretion), see the Spirit Mastery list (<a href="#SL_3.2.3">Section 3.2.3</a>).</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The Demon always leaves if uncontrolled or unmastered. In order to handle the Types of Demons a GM uses in his world system, he may want to change the % chance of failure for summoning spells and the penalties outlined above.</p>
<h4>DEMON CONTACTS</h4>
<p>When a Demon is “contacted” (see the Dark Contacts list, <a href="#SL_3.8.4">Section 3.8.4</a>), it contact is gradually extablished over the course of two rounds. If the Demon is not <em>Forced</em> (i.e., usually by one of the spells on the Dark Contacts list: <em>Force Analysis</em>, <em>Force Information</em>, or <em>Force Search</em>) before contact is established, the caster suffers an effect. Make a d100 roll (open-ended) and add the Demon’s Type times 10. Use this roll to determine the effect that the caster suffers (no RR):</p>
<ul>
<li> If the result is less than 90, roll on the attack column of the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.6">Spell Failure Table 6.6</a>, caster takes the result.</li>
<li> If the result is less than 90, the effect depends on the Force spell that the caster attempted:
<p><em>No Force Spell:</em> Caster takes d5 ‘A’ Impact criticals. </p>
<p><em>Force Analysis:</em> Caster loses item to be analyzed; </p>
<p><em>Force Information:</em> Caster is in a coma for d10 days; </p>
<p><em>Force Search:</em> Demon gives caster a Quest (GM discretion), see the Spirit Mastery list (<a href="#SL_3.2.3">Section 3.2.3</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to handle the Types of Demons a GM uses in his world system, he may want to change the % chance of failure for contact spells and the penalties outlined above.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Demons gain information by common knowledge among Demons, by contacting other Demons, or by observing the human plane (mentally and physically).
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_7.1.32">7.1.32 </a>Slaying Criticals For Spells</h3>
<p>When a certain type of spell delivers a critical to a specific Large or Super Large creature, a GM may want to treat the critical as “slaying” (i.e., use the Slaying columns on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.5">Creature Critical Strike Table 6.5</a>). This process should be used when a target is particularly vunerable to the element or force of a spell. Some common examples include:</p>
<table summary="" >

<tr><td>Air Elemental</td><td>Vacuum </td></tr>
<tr><td>Fire Drake</td><td>Fire Bolt </td></tr>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/HEALING,DEATH, AND INJURY" -->
<h2><a name="SL_7.2">7.2 </a>HEALING,DEATH, AND INJURY</h2>
<p>Because so much of FRP action involves situations where characters are hurt or killed, <strong><em>Rolemaster (RM)</em></strong> provides detailed and comprehensive guidelines covering specific injuries, death, and healing. These rules around certain basic principals or assumptions.</p>
<h4>BODY AND SOUL</h4>
<p>In <strong><em>RM</em></strong>, life is a union of body and soul. The body is a physical (or, in rare cases, enchanted) construct which accommodates the intangible soul or spirit. In turn, the soul gives the body life. Without a body, a soul dissipates and cannot interact in normal affairs. Without a soul, a body is little more than an unordered organic sculpture destined to rot away.<br />
Death occurs when the body can no longer function (i.e., it cannot convey the soul) or the soul withers away (i.e., it cannot convey life to the body). When the body can no longer function, this is referred to as physical death. When the soul withers away, this is referred to as soul death.<br />
Physical death can occur in one of two ways. The first is from a critical wound, or series of critical wounds (i.e., critical strikes). The second is shut down due to pain or system shock (i.e., hits).<br />
Soul death can occur in one of two ways. The first is through an Absolution spell (cast by an evil priest) or any other soul destroying spell in the realm of Channeling. The other form of soul death occurs through prolonged exposure to Undead (sometimes called Unlife, creatures of the night, etc.).<br />
Once the body ceases to function, the soul will eventually depart. When the soul separates from the body, any prospects for recovery are remote.</p>
<h4>GENERAL DEGREES OF INJURY</h4>
<p>These wound categories help a Gamemaster apply certain general rules regarding recovery and effect.</p>
<p><strong>Light Injuries —</strong> If a specific injury results in a penalty of -0 to -20, it is considered “light.” In addition, light injuries include wounds which yield 1-5 hits per round as a result of bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>Medium Injuries —</strong> Specific injuries which result in a penalty of -21 to -50 are considered to be of “medium” severity. Medium injuries also include wounds which yield 6-10 hits per round as a result of bleeding. Fractures with an unspecified penalty are medium injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Severe Injuries —</strong> Should a specific injury result in a penalty of -51 or more, it is “severe.” In addition, sever injuries include shattered bones and wounds which yield more than 10 hits per round as a result of bleeding. Any wound which destroys an organ (e.g., eye, kidney, etc.) or renders it inoperable for more than 1 day is also severe.</p>
<h4>HEALING SPELLS</h4>
<p><em>Spell Law</em> provides several complete sets of spells for healing (Closed Channeling, Healer, Lay Healer, etc.). In a campaign game, healing spells might be available in towns and cities. The Gamemaster should experiment with costs and requirements for healing services. Options include everything from mercenary spell users requiring money for their services to suspicious channelers who will only heal “true believers” of their religion (or race). Large settlements might contain readily accessible healing runes.</p>
<h4>NATURAL HEALING</h4>
<p>The body often heals itself, albeit slowly. Even without aid of spells, herbs or medicine, an adventurer can rally from most injuries. The chart below shows the recovery time for the most common types of injuries. Note that the chart below should only be used with wounds gained through critical strikes. Concussion damage taken (i.e., hits) heals in a different fashion (see the discussion on Recovery below).<br />
To use the chart below, roll d100 (open-ended) and add three times the character’s Constitution bonus. Look up the result in the section for the most appropriate type of wound (the chart is subdivided into sections based upon types of damage) to determine the number days needed for a given wound to heal. Note that a separate roll should be made for each wound. See the section on injuries (below) for guidelines on how to classify wounds as Light, Medium, or Severe wounds.<br />
A complete examination of the uses and effects of healing herbs, first aid and medicine can be found in <em>Gamemaster Law</em>.</p>
<h4>SPRAINS</h4>
<p>Sprains are the result of a wrenching or laceration of the ligaments of a joint. A sprain will heal normally as a medium muscle/tendon wound but must be protected from further strain during this time.</p>
<h4>NERVE DAMAGE</h4>
<p>Nerve damage is characterized as the severing or traumatization of a nerve or nerves vital to some body function. The effects of nerve damage can vary widely, from complete loss of feeling or control of a limb, to uncontrollable shaking or trembling, to unbearable and continuing pain. There are several circumstances under which nerve damage will be a result:</p>
<ul>
<li> If a Critical result specifically denotes nerve damage, then the full described penalty is ascribed to nerve damage.</li>
<li> If a critical describes a limb or organ as useless or destroyed, nerve damage equal to the severity of the wound has occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there is a chance that any wound will also yield nerve damage. The chance of nerve damage is equal to the penalty expressed as a percentage (i.e., -50 = 50%), if any. If nerve damage has occurred, then a nerve damagepenalty <strong>equal</strong> to the original penalty is present. This penalty is not <em>cumulative</em> with the original penalty, but must be healed as if it were a separate wound, and recovery times are rolled on the chart for organ damage. Note that this may mean that the penalty due to the original wound may heal before the nerve damage associated with it does.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Blackfire (aka Uncle Skippy) has strained his shoulder trying to shave his back. After assessing the -30 penalty, the GM rolls d100 vs. the 30% chance that nerve damage has occurred. A 17 is rolled, and Uncle Skippy curses his luck. A roll for the strained muscles in the medium category results in a recovery time of 8 days, but the roll for recovery from the nerve damage results in a recovery time of 30 days. Uncle Skippy resolves in future to stretch out before attempting personal hygiene.
</blockquote>
<p>The PC must make an open-ended d100 roll, adding his three times his Constitution bonus. If this modified result is less than or equal to the original penalty expressed as a positive number (i.e., -30 becomes “30” for this purpose), there is a permanent penalty equal to half the original penalty. If this roll is failed by over 50, a permanent penalty equal to the full original penalty is applied. This penalty can only be removed through magical healing, as the nerve damage is considered permanent.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Solrac (the Bringer of Death to you, buddy), has managed to injure himself reaching for the toilet paper. In the ensuing scuffle with a towel rack, Solrac deals himself an injury from a ‘D’ Grappling Critical, resulting in a -40 penalty of an unspecified duration, which makes it a medium injury. Solrac’s Constitution is a paltry 23 (with a -5 Constitution bonus, he doesn’t bring death to very many). Rolling the dice, he rolls (yipe!) an 09! The final modified roll is an 04, which means that Solrac will be operating under a permanent penalty of -20. Solrac’s player breathes a sigh of relief. Had he rolled 5 less on the dice, it would have been open-ended low, and he would likely have had a permanent penalty of -40! As it is, the nerve trauma is severe enough that Solrac will have to find a magical healer to repair the destroyed nerves. Solrac swears vengeance on the architect.
</blockquote>
<h4>HEALING THE SOUL</h4>
<p>Proximity to Undead can often “damage” the soul. In turn, this weakens the physical body. The only cures available for this type of healing are magical (via “soul healing” spells) or time and rest.<br />
Damage to the soul from proximity to Undead must be tracked seperately, but the effects are reflected in a temporary reduction of the Constitution stat. See the discussion on Recovery below for details on how to heal the soul.</p>
<h4>HEALING ANIMALS</h4>
<p>Most of the healing spells in Spell Law are intended for use in healing humans (and humanoids). The GM may decide to allow these same spells to heal animals of their wounds.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.2.1">7.2.1 </a>Death</h3>
<p>As noted above, death comes in more than one form, although it inevitably leads to the sundering of the body and soul. These unfortunately fatal situations require further elaboration.</p>
<h4>MAJOR WOUNDS</h4>
<p>Occasionally, a mortal blow or combination of blows will fell a character who has not yet fallen unconscious. In these cases, an attack or accident results in a critical strike that specifies damage to a particular part of the character’s body. Should the critical strike description specify that the effects are fatal, the character dies in the prescribed manner and at the specified time, unless someone or something intervenes.</p>
<h4>MASSIVE SHOCK</h4>
<p>Each character has a number of concussion hits (or simply “hits”). These hits reflect the amount of pain and beating the character can withstand before succumbing to shock or unconsciousness. Once a character receives an amount of concussion damage equal to or greater than his hits, he passes out due to body shock.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> The Rolemaster Standard System has a detailed description on how to determine how many concussion hits a character has.
</blockquote>
<p>If a character receives more concussion hits than the sum of his total hits plus his Constitution stat (not his stat bonus), he begins to die. After a number of rounds equal to twelve (12) plus his Constitution bonus and the racial soul departure bonus. This process of dying can be halted by healing concussion hits on the character (i.e., casting simple healing spells). However, once a character is dead, the rules for death apply (see <a href="#SL_7.2.2">Effects of Death</a> below).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Jaide, a halfling (+6 racial soul departure bonus), has 34 concussion hits and a 90 Constitution (+5 Constitution bonus). He receives 125 hits after a few rounds of brutal fighting. Once he reaches 34 hits, he drops unconscious. Once he reaches 125 hits, begins to die of massive shock. If he does not receive aid within 23 rounds (12+5+6), he will be irrevocably dead (to normal efforts) due to soul departure.
</blockquote>
<h4>SOUL DEATH</h4>
<p>There are a few spells (most in the realm of Channeling) that destroy or banish souls. When this occurs, the character is irrevocably dead. GMs should be aware that this is a particularly brutal (and powerful) way for a character to die and should control the availability of such spells.</p>
<h4>UNDEAD</h4>
<p>Undead are the antithesis of all that is living. They gain their power by draining life from the living. This is reflected by temporarily lowering a character’s Constitution stat. If a character’s Constitution drops to 0 (or less), the character’s soul has withered away and he becomes an Undead himself. While this is a gruesome thing to have happen, it never happens quickly (and characters can work at healing this damage).<br />
For a complete discussion on Undead, <em>see Creatures and Monsters</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.2.2">7.2.2 </a>Effects of Death</h3>
<p>There are two major effects of death:</p>
<ol>
<li> The deterioration of stats due to a lack of oxygen flow to the brain following “death,” and</li>
<li> the departure of the soul from the body.</li>
</ol>
<p>Spells or herbs can halt the process of dying at any point. A <em>Preservation</em> spell or its equivalent medicine halts the deterioration of the stats. A <em>Lifekeeping</em> spell delays the departure of the soul from the body (though <em>Lifekeeping</em> does not restore deteriorated stats). Healing the cause of death also halts both effects, but does not reverse them.<br />
If the cause of death is healed before the soul leaves the body, the person is alive and functional (if there are no other injuries, and no stat is reduced to 0); however, any stat loss remains. If the soul has left the body before the cause of death is repaired, the body is functional, but the character is in a coma and at -100 for even subconscious activity. A Lifegiving spell must be cast on such a character before he can become functional once again (see <em>Spell Law</em> for specific spell descriptions).</p>
<h4>STAT LOSS</h4>
<p>The mental stats (Memory, Reasoning, Empathy, and Intuition) as well as the two partially mental stats (Self Discipline and Presence) will deteriorate first. Each round after death, consult the chart above to determine the die-type rolled to determine the amount each stat drops (to a minimum of 0).<br />
Every hour after a temporary stat is reduced to 0, the potential for that stat is reduced by d10-1.<br />
Ten minutes (60 rounds) after death, the physical stats (Constitution, Agility, Strength, and Quickness) begin to deteriorate. Each hour, roll d10-1 for each of these stats. The result is how many points the stat drops (to a minimum of 0). However, this process continues after a stat drops to 0, with all remaining loss taken from the stat’s potential.<br />
If any stat falls to 0, the character remains in a coma even if the cause of death is repaired (and the stat stays at 0). The character can be brought out of this coma if the stat(s) that is at 0 is raised above 0. Deteriorated temporary stats can be raised to previous levels by the following methods: normal level advancement, certain healing spells (or herbs), and/or by a normal healing rate of 1 point per stat per month. If potentials have deteriorated, stats cannot be raised above the new potentials (only very power magic can raise lowered potentials).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Snidepucker the Rogue dies after eating a poisoned bagel. Beginning the round after death, the GM rolls for stat loss on each mental stat and the two partially mental stats. Each result is subtracted from the temporary stat. Soon Snidepucker’s temporary Memory reaches 0. The GM will now only roll once per hour for the Memory stat and all loss will now be applied to the potential stat. Sixty rounds after death, the GM begins the same process for Snidepucker’s physical stats. He will continue to roll for loss until all potential stats fall to 0.
</blockquote>
<p>During a battle, the GM should keep track of how many rounds pass between death and the halting of the death process. After the resolution of the battle, he can perform all of the die rolls needed for stat reductions.</p>
<h4>PRESERVATION</h4>
<p>Note that the various <em>Preservation</em> spells prevent any and all stat loss or decomposition during the duration of the spell.</p>
<h4>SOUL DEPARTURE</h4>
<p>Normally, two minutes (12 rounds) after death, a character’s soul leaves his body. The exact time for departure will vary by the race of the dead character. Once the soul departs from the body it can only be returned through the use of powerful spells or herbs (e.g., <em>Lifegiving</em>).</p>
<h4>SOUL WITHERING</h4>
<p>If a character’s Constitution has been lowered to 0 because of proximity to Undead creatures, the character becomes an Undead himself. See <em>Creatures & Monsters</em> for a discussion on how Undead are created to determine the type of Undead the character might become.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.2.3">7.2.3 </a>Injuries</h3>
<p>Although death is a looming danger, injuries are much more common. Some injuries, however, effectively disable a character. Most make adventuring tough and, given their frequency, can present the characters with significant obstacles, including penalties or prohibitions applicable to the use of appendages, the deployment of sense, maneuvers, combat or event simple travel.<br />
Generally, injuries in <strong><em>RM</em></strong> only occur as a result of damage from a critical strike. As such, the injuries are often described quite specifically. This provides a tremendous variety of effects and adds flavor to the game. It also requires a very specific healing system, spells, and herbs covering every possible plight. The healing spells found in <strong><em>RM</em></strong> are designed to provide detailed descriptions covering any injury that might arise in a game.</p>
<h4>LIGHT INJURIES</h4>
<p>If a specific injury results in a penalty of -0 to -20, it is considered “light.” In addition, wounds that bleed at the rate of 1 to 5 hits per round are considered “light.” No fracture or break is ever a light injury.</p>
<h4>MEDIUM INJURIES</h4>
<p>Specific injuries that result in a penalty of -21 to -50 are considered “medium” in severity. Medium injuries also include wounds that bleed at the rate of 6 to 10 hits per round. Fractures or breaks that result in an unspecified penalty are always considered medium in severity.</p>
<h4>SEVERE INJURY</h4>
<p>Should a specific injury result in a penalty of -51 or more, it is “severe.” In addition, severe injuries include shattered bones and wounds that bleed more than 10 hits per round. Any wound that destroys an organ, or renders an organ inoperable for more than one day is also severe.</p>
<h4>TREATMENT</h4>
<p>Even after an injury is treated, recovery is rarely instantaneous. The Gamemaster must still consider the effect of the wound after treatment. For instance, how long does it take to recover? Will there be any permanent damage (e.g., scars or a lowering of stats)? What effect does the wound have on the character while he is recovering?<br />
The form of treatment for a given injury is normally prescribed by:</p>
<ol>
<li> the description of the wound, or</li>
<li> by the explanation of the spell, medical technique, or herb employed.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, some injuries are healed by spells with descriptions that require the victim to remain immobilized during treatment. Certain herbs must be administered with an external compress which cannot be jarred. Whatever the treatment, the procedures should be followed, or the wound is not considered healed (and recovery will not begin).</p>
<h4>FIRST AID</h4>
<p>First aid can be attempted by any character, but has limited effectiveness. To attempt to assist using first aid, a character must make a successful first aid static maneuver (see the <em><strong>Rolemaster</strong> Standard Rules</em> for an explanation of how to perform this maneuver).<br />
First aid skills allow a character to heal any “light” injury, if the necessary equipment is available (e.g., a compress and bandage for light bleeding, splints or slings for sprains, etc.). In addition, this skill can be used to slow or halt the effects of medium or severe injuries. For example, a severe bleeding wound (bleeding at more than 10 hits per round), can be slowed by 5 hits per round using <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">first aid skills</a>. First aid is not effective when dealing with medium or severe nerve or organ damage.<br />
Once first aid has been applied, the victim cannot engage in any activity that might strain the wounded area without losing the benefits from the first aid. For example, a character cannot receive first aid for a wound and then move at a pace faster than a walk without “re-opening” the wound.<br />
It should be noted that should a wound be reduced by first aid, it cannot then be further reduced by future first aid attempts.</p>
<h4>WOUNDS</h4>
<p>Wounds are generally defined as the specific damage taken from a critical hit. When an injury description specifies that the organ, appendage, etc. is useless, the penalty is considered -100. As a general rule, the recuperation period for multiple injuries equals that of the worst wound plus half the recovery time for all other wounds (cumulative).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> As a result of a swindle, Onree moves into an unsound tower. A storm erupts and the tower collapses in the wind. In the fall, Onree receives a severe head wound (recovery time 30 days), a medium bone wound (recovery time 8 days), and a light skin wound (recovery time 1 day). Assuming he is healed, his total recovery time is 34.5 days (30 + 4 + 0.5). Poor Onree.
</blockquote>
<p>While recovering, a character’s penalties gradually lessen. To determine the rate at which the character returns to normal health, divide the total penalty by the recovery time (in days). The result is the daily reduction in the character’s penalty. Round off any fractions and apply any leftover penalty to the amount recovered in the first day. If the recovery time is two days or less, the Gamemaster may want to determine recovery on an hourly basis.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Onree received a total penalty of -70 as a result of his accident. If his recovery time is 34.5 days, he divides 70 by 34.5, with a result of 2.03. He rounds this to 2. Thus, Onree’s penalty is reduced by 2 each day of recuperation. Because 2 times 34.5 is only 69, there is an additional 1 remainder. This is applied to the first day of recovery (meaning that Onree’s penalty is reduced by 3 during the first day).
</blockquote>
<h4>HITS</h4>
<p>Recovering from concussion hit loss occurs at the rate of 1 hit per hour of sleep or rest. While performing non-strenuous activities, recovery rate drops to 1 hit per 3 hours of activity. If the character is generally active (including traveling), no concussion hits will be regained (until such a time as the character can rest).</p>
<h4>SOUL WITHERING</h4>
<p>Soul damage is much slower in healing. The GM (and player) should keep track of the amount of Constitution lost to the effects of Undead. This damage normally heals at the rate of 1 point per day if the character is doing nothing but resting and recuperating. If the character is not travelling and generally staying in one place, he will heal up 1 point per week. This process can be expedited by spending time if the character is in a place soothing and sacred to him (2 points per day or 2 points per week).<br />
It is possible to speed up the recovery from soul damage by spending time on “holy” or “consecrated” ground. A character will gain an extra d10 points of healing per day spent on this type of ground.<br />
Finally, there are specific “soul-healing” spells that speed up the recovery process, or heal points directly. See the Cleansing spell list (Healer base).</p>
<h4>PERMANENT DAMAGE</h4>
<p>Permanent damage should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Gamemaster. As a loose rule-of-thumb, a character should receive permanent damage only in the case of a severe wound. For each severe wound, the character should roll an open-ended d100 and add his current Constitution (the stat itself, not the bonus). If the roll is greater than 100, no permanent damage is sustained. If the roll falls short of 100, the GM should assign permanent damage based upon how short the roll was from 100.
The exact nature of the permanent damage should be decided by the Gamemaster, but should be appropriate to the wound. For example, having an arm severed and then reattached might result in a permanent loss of agility (and a scar); physical death following by a re-uniting of the soul and body might cause some experience loss; etc.</p>

<h2><a name="SL_7.3">7.3 </a>EVIL SPELL LISTS</h2>
<p>Evil spell lists are included for evil spell users in all three realms: <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>, <span id="essence">Essence</span>, and <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>. These lists reflect the dark sides of <span id="essence">Essence</span>, <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> and <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>. A GM should realize that this is a high subjective and flexible concept and should reflect this in his world system. This could range from an evil spell user being perverted and manipulated by evil gods and power sources to minimal effects like the disapproval of superstitious peasants.<br />
Evil spell users are always pure spell users (i.e., they have access to only one realm). They are the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Evil Magician</a>, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Evil Cleric</a>, and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist">Evil Mentalist</a>. An evil spell user has the five evil lists of his realm as his standard set of base lists as well at the six base lists of the corresponding profession for that realm (e.g., an Evil Magician would have the Magician base lists as his additional base lists). An evil spell user should <strong>not</strong> be allowed to choose additional base lists as outlined in <a href="#SL_5.4">Section 5.4</a>.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/ALCHEMIST LISTS AND ITEM CREATION" -->
<h2><a name="SL_7.4">7.4 </a>ALCHEMIST LISTS AND ITEM CREATION</h2>
<p>This section presents guidelines for item creation using the Alchemist spell lists presented in <a href="#SL_9.2">Section 9.2</a>. This material is intended for GMs that do not use the <strong><em>RM Standard System</em></strong>, but it can also be used by <strong><em>RM</em></strong> GMs when the <em>Alchemy Companion</em> is not avaiable.<br />
In any comprehensive world system for a long-running campaign, attention must be paid to explaining where magic items come from. Of course, the simplest solution to this is to say that spells and items come from the gods (or some other external force) and allow no research in terms of the game. If this is the case, the Alchemist spell lists and this section should be ignored. The following sections contain some of the suggested rules for item creation in conjunction with using <em>Spell Law</em>.</p>
<h5 align="center">&bull; &bull; &bull;</h5>
<p>Alchemical research is the only way in which a spell user can make a specific magic item, potion, or enchanted material (as opposed to Lord Research, <a href="#SL_7.4.6">Section 7.4.6</a>, which is essentially random). Under our system, the Alchemist Base spell lists (<a href="#SL_9.2">Section 9.2</a>) provide the necessary framework for making specific items; they are usually usable only by Alchemists (see <a href="#SL_7.4.7">Section 7.4.7</a> for some suggested exceptions). Making a magic item consists of simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li> Creating the base item (always required)</li>
<li> Enchanting the item (not required)</li>
<li> Imbedding spells into the item (not required)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a magic item has been created it cannot normally have other spells or abilities added (except for recharging wands, rods and staves). The GM is always relied upon to make necessary modifications to these rules to adapt them to specific circumstances in his world system.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.4.1">7.4.1 </a>Creating the Base Item</h3>
<p>The base item is the actual physical item which may be enchanted or have a spell imbedded. Base items are classified as:</p>
<ul>
<li> Inorganic (metal)</li>
<li> Organic (living or once living material)</li>
<li> Liquid/Gas (potions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these classifications is represented by one of the Alchemist Base lists. Each list allows an Alchemist to work the appropriate materials through the use of spells, aided by normal equipment (forges, looms, presses, laboratory apparatus, etc.).<br />
Making the base item requires that the appropriate spell from the appropriate list be cast once per day (that’s why the duration of many Alchemist Base spells is 24 hours). It is also assumed that the Alchemist works normal full days (8-10 hours) on the project (no spell research, excursions, or other projects).<br />
In order to make a base item, some of the following spells must be cast during the creation process:</p>
<ul>
<li> <em>Work xxx</em> — always required, even if the material to be worked, <em>xxx</em>, is already in the desired shape/form.</li>
<li> <em>Make xxx</em> — required if the material to be worked, <em>xxx</em>, is only available in the form of raw materials; see the individual spell descriptions (e.g., to make a steel weapon from available iron, a Make Steel spell is required).</li>
<li> <em>Make Wand</em>, <em>Make Rod</em>, or <em>Make Staff</em> — required to make a Wand, Rod, Staff so that it can be charged with an imbedded spell; see <A href="#SL_7.4.3">Section 7.4.3</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exception to the above requirements is rune paper, which can be created merely by casting the appropriate <em>Rune Paper #</em> spell (i.e., no other <em>Make xxx</em> or <em>Work xxx</em> spells are required).</p>
<h4>THE BASE ITEMS</h4>
<p>The properties of the base items is summarized on the Items Characteristics Chart.</p>
<p><strong>Wands, Rods and Staves</strong> — Wands, rods, and staves are the primary base items for storing spells that can be cast multiple times. Normally they must be organic due to the inherent resistance of inorganic material to spells. In order to make one of these items, the Alchemist must know the appropriate spell on the Organic Skills list (i.e., <em>Make Wand</em> to make a wand, <em>Make Rod</em> to make a rod, or <em>Make Staff</em> to make a staff).</p>
<p><strong>Rune Paper</strong> — Spell users must have rune paper in order to inscribe runes (see the Open Essence list, Rune Mastery, <a href="#SL_3.1.8">Section 3.1.8</a>). The various <em>Rune Paper #</em> spells allow rune paper to be made which will hold various level spells (e.g., rune paper made with a <em>Rune Paper III</em> spell will only hold 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level spells).</p>
<p><strong>Potions</strong> — Potions are fluids (or in some cases, gases) in which a spell can be placed (imbedded). The various <em>Potion #</em> spells make potions which will hold various level spells as rune paper does. “Potion” spells are harder (higher level) to both learn and use because there can be no requirement that the end user have any understanding of spells (reading Runes requires Runes skill and need not be as foolproof).</p>
<p><strong>Objects</strong> — Objects are any items that are not wands, rods, staves, rune paper, or potions in the sense outlined above. They include weapons, armor, spell bonus items, rings, cloaks, boots, etc.</p>
<p>If they are created out of superior materials (assuming iron as a normal, non-bonus material), weapons, armor, and other items can have bonuses that are non-magical. In this case, creating a base item need not be accompanied by enchantment or imbedding a spell.<br />
If weapons and armor are enchanted to get a magical bonus, then the user can elect to use either the non-magical bonus (due to material) or the magical bonus (but not both).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A high-steel weapon (+10) enchanted with a +5 bonus could be used as a +10 normal weapon or a +5 magic weapon, but not as a +15 weapon. In most cases it would be used as a +10 weapon, but when fighting creatures which can only be hit by magic weapons, the +5 bonus would have
to be used.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_7.4.2">7.4.2 </a>Enchanting an Item</h3>
<p>Enchanted properties of an item do not normally require <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> (i.e., Staves & Wands) skill to use . Standard enchantments include:</p>
<ul>
<li> Intelligence</li>
<li> Magical bonuses</li>
<li> Any special permanent abilities which are not spells (e.g., Holy Arms or Slaying are such abilities, while flying, and teleportation are normally not such abilities)</li>
</ul>
<p>When an Alchemist wishes to enchant an object, he must perform the enchantment process simultaneously with the creation of the base item and the imbedding of spells (if any). The enchantment process consists of casting the appropriate spell from the Enchanting Ways list once per day during the item creation process (e.g., to make an item enchanted with “Low Intelligence”, the spell Low Intelligence must be cast1/day while the item is being created).</p>
<h4>INTELLIGENCE</h4>
<p>The effect of intelligent items on characters or a game will depend upon the world system used (e.g., control or dominance of a character by an item he is using). Normally, the “alignment” of such an item is the same as that of the Alchemist that makes it.<br />
In terms of Rolemaster, intelligence allows any character to use spells “imbedded” in items (see <a href="#SL_7.4.3">Section 7.4.3</a>) without having to successfully use his Attunement skill. Normally, a spell may not be cast from an item unless: the wielder has made a successfully Attunement skill maneuver for the item or the item has the intelligence neccessary for casting the spell as outlined below.<br />
The following is a summary of the effects of various intelligences that can be placed in an item by the corresponding spells on the Enchanting Ways list (<a href="#SL_9.2.1">Section 9.2.1</a>):</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Intelligence</th><th> Allows</th></tr>
<tr><td>Empathy</td><td>Casting of 1st lvl spells </td></tr>
<tr><td>Low</td><td>Casting of 2nd lvl spells </td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>Casting of 5th lvl spells </td></tr>
<tr><td>High</td><td>Casting of 10th lvl spells </td></tr>
<tr><td>Very High</td><td>Casting of 20th lvl spells</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>BONUSES</h4>
<p>Bonuses fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Weapons</strong> — Normally a weapon bonus gives an additional bonus to the wielder’s Offensive Bonus. <em>Weapon</em> I gives a weapon a magical +5 bonus, <em>Weapon II</em> gives a magical +10 bonus, etc.</li>
<li><strong> Armor & Shields</strong> — Normally a shield bonus or an armor bonus gives a bonus to wielder’s Defensive Bonus. <em>Armor I</em> gives a shield or a suit of armor a magical +5 bonus, <em>Armor II</em> gives a shield or a suit of armor a magical +10 bonus, etc.</li>
<li><strong> General</strong> — Normally a general item bonus gives a bonus when performing the normal function of the item. <em>General I</em> gives a “specific use” item (e.g., a grappling hook, a bridle, a ink pen, etc.) a magical +5 bonus, <em>General II</em> gives a “specific use” item a magical +10 bonus, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general category also handles creating power point multipliers and adders. A +# General spell will enchant either “+# adder” or a “x (# – 1) multiplier.”</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A +10 Lockpick fall into the General category and would give an additional +10 bonus when used to pick locks. A +4 General spell can be used to create a +4 spell adder or a x3 power point multiplier.
</blockquote><blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> A weapon bonus gives a specific add to the combat attack of the character using that weapon; each “I” of an enchantment gives a bonus of +1 to the combat roll under a 1-20 system, and +5 under a 1-100 system. Similarly, each +1 for an armor bonus (or shields) gives a subtraction to the attack roll of persons attacking the character who is wearing the armor. The +1 general category is meant for the miscellaneous items which exist in various world systems (e.g., +1 rings, or cloaks).
</blockquote>
<h4>SPECIAL ENCHANTMENT</h4>
<p>All enchantment aside from intelligence and bonuses falls into this category. Because they are too numerous to catalog and are highly dependent upon the world system being used, these special enchantments are not specifically covered by spells on the Enchanting Ways list.<br />
If a GM feels that a special enchanted ability is standard for Alchemists in his world system, he may place a spell for enchanting that ability at any level on the Enchanting Ways list that he deems appropriate.<br /> Otherwise, an Alchemist should be required to research the enchantment spell for that ability using the spell research rules detailed in <a href="#SL_7.5">Section 7.5</a>. This research should require that the researcher cast the 1st level Research spell on the Enchanted Ways list once per day.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> An Alchemist wishes to enchant a sword to be an Orc-slaying weapon. If the GM decides that the ability is a known Alchemist enchantment, he might assign it a level of 15. If not, he could still assign it a level of 15, but the Alchemist would be required to research the spell for 11 months and 1 week as required in <a href="SL_7.5">Section 7.5</a>. It might even take longer if the Gamemaster decides the ability is really obscure and requires the research time for a spell not on a normal list; triple normal time: <time>2 years, 9 months and 3 weeks</time>.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_7.4.3">7.4.3 </a>Imbedding Spells</h3>
<p>Spells can be imbedded in items by casting the appropriate spell or spells from one of the Alchemist Base lists, Imbed Essence or Imbed Mentalism/Channeling. While a Base Item (see <a href="#SL_7.4.1">Section 7.4.1</a>) is being created, several procedures must be performed in order to imbed a spell:</p>
<ol>
<li> The appropriate <em>Imbed #</em> spell for the appropriate realm must be cast on the item once a day (that’s why the Duration of many Alchemist Base spells is 24 hours).</li>
<li> The spell to be imbedded must also be cast on the item once a day while creating the item (this spell can be cast by the Alchemist, an item, or another spell user).</li>
<li> If the item is to be a Wand, a Rod, or a Staff, then the appropriate <em>Charge xxx</em> spell must be cast on the item once a day.</li>
<li> If the item is to be a Daily item, or a Constant item, then the appropriate <em>Daily #</em> or <em>Constant</em> spell must be cast on the item once a day.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because an Alchemist is a Pure spell user of Essence, the Mentalism and Channeling spells are harder (higher level) to imbed than Essence spells.</p>
<h4>NORMAL IMBEDDING</h4>
<p>If only procedures 1 and 2 above are performed, the spell imbedded can only be used <strong>once</strong>. After such a spell is cast, it is gone and cannot be recharged.</p>
<h4>CHARGED ITEMS: WANDS, RODS, STAVES</h4>
<p>Multiple spell charges can be imbedded in Wands (10), Rods (30), and Staves (100). This requires that:</p>
<ul>
<li> The base item must be of the appropriate type (i.e., Wand, Rod, or Staff; see <a href="#SL_7.4.1">Section 7.4.1</a>).</li>
<li> The appropriate <em>Charge xxx</em> spell must be cast on the item (in addition to the other required spells) once per day while the item is being created.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike other items with imbedded spells, Wands, Rods and Staves can be recharged by casting the appropriate <em>Charge xxx</em> spell once a day for a number of consecutive weeks equal to the level of the <em>Charge xxx</em> spell (e.g., recharging an Essence Rod would require an 8th level <em>Charge Rod</em> spell and <time>8 weeks</time>). The properties of wands, rods and staves are summarized in the Item Characteristics Chart.</p>
<blockquote id="option">
<strong>Option:</strong> If a GM does not wish to keep track of the charges on items in his world, he may wish to roll (1-100) each time a Charged Item is used. If the roll is less than a certain number, then the last charge in the item has been used. The suggested values for the chance of charge depletion are provided on the Item Characteristics Chart: 1-10 (10%) for Wands, 1-4 (4%) for Rods, and 1-1 (1%) for Staves. Note that this is not cumulative, thus a Charged Item will continue to function until a low enough roll is made, and may potentially function forever).
</blockquote>
<h4>DAILY ITEMS</h4>
<p>A spell can be imbedded in an item so that the imbedded spell can be cast a certain number of times per day. This requires the appropriate <em>Daily #</em> spell be cast once a day while creating the item.<br />
The number of times per day that such an imbedded spell may be cast is dependent upon the level of the imbedded spell and the <em>#</em> of the <em>Daily #</em> spell used (see the individual <em>Daily #</em> spell descriptions).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A high level Alchemist is making a ring and casts a “Daily 3” spell. He may either imbed a 1st level spell to be used up to three times each day or a 2nd or 3rd level spell that could be used once each day.
</blockquote>
<h4>CONSTANT ITEMS</h4>
<p>A spell can be imbedded in an item so that the imbedded spell works continuously (i.e., constantly). This requires the appropriate <em>Constant</em> spell be cast once a day while creating the item.<br />
Only spells deemed appropriate to work constantly can be imbedded in this manner (to be determined by the GM, of course). Allowable spells might include: <em>Detect</em> spells, <em>Invisibility</em>, <em>Presence</em>, etc. Non-allowable spells might include: elemental attack spells, base attack spells, <em>Teleport</em>, etc.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> One viable option for a GM is to only allow rings to be Constant items. Only one spell per ring can be imbedded. Only two rings can be worn and used per character (except in extreme circumstances to be determined by the GM).
</blockquote>
<h4>RESEARCHING IMBED SPELLS</h4>
<p>If a GM feels that a more specific Imbed spell is standard for Alchemists in his world system, he may place such a spell at any level on the appropriate Imbedding list. Otherwise, an Alchemist should be required to research the Imbed spell using the spell research rules detailed in <a href="#SL_7.5">Section 7.5</a>. This research should require that the researcher cast the 1st level Research spell on the appropriate Imbedding list once per day.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A character might wish to research a spell that would imbed “At Will” spells (i.e., an “At Will” imbedded spell would cast a certain spell whenever the character willed it). The GM could decide that this would be handled like the Constant spell, and require the character to research “At Will” as a 50th level spell.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_7.4.4">7.4.4 </a>The Cost of Making Magic Items</h3>
<p>The cost of making magic items is reflected by several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li> Time (see below).</li>
<li> Required spells and Power Points (see Sections <a href="#SL_7.4.1">7.4.1</a>-<a href="#SL_7.4.3">7.4.3</a>)</li>
<li> Material and possibly money (depends upon world system)</li>
<li> Standard research costs if necessary (see <a href="#SL_7.5">Section 7.5</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These costs have been designed to make magic item creation difficult but not outrageous. Note that the price of such items, when and if ever sold, should reflect these costs, including the (perhaps) years the Alchemist worked on the item. See <em>Gamemaster Law</em> for some guidelines for determining the cost/value of standard magic items.</p>
<h4>TIME COST</h4>
<p>Time is the key factor in the cost of making a magic item. The time cost is given in terms of a number of required consecutive weeks. Making a magic item consists of simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li> Creating the <strong>base item</strong> — This costs one week per level of spell used in creating the base item; see <a href="#SL_7.4.1">Section 7.4.1</a> for the list of required spells. The spells normally cast for the base item are:
<ul>
<li> The <em>Work xxx</em> spell</li>
<li> A <em>Make xxx</em> spell (if there is one)</li>
<li> A <em>Make Wand</em>, <em>Rod</em>, or <em>Staff</em> spell (if there is one)</li></ul></li>
<li> Placing an <strong>enchanted ability</strong> in the item — There can be multiple enchanted abilities in an item; for the purposes of time cost (see below) treat each enchanted ability as a separate <em>capability</em>. See <a href="#SL_7.4.2">Section 7.4.2</a> for required spells. Only one spell from the Enchanting Ways list is normally required for an enchanted ability.</li>
<li> Placing an <strong>imbedded spell</strong> in the item — There can be multiple imbedded spells in an item; for the purposes of time cost (see below) treat each imbedded spell as a separate capability. See <a href="#SL_7.4.3">Section 7.4.3</a> for the list of required spells. The spells normally cast for an imbedded spell are:
<ul>
<li> The spell imbedded</li>
<li> The <em>Imbed #</em> spell</li>
<li> A <em>Charge xxx</em>, <em>Daily #</em>, or <em>Constant</em> spell (if one)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Base Item Time Cost:</strong> Creating the base item costs one week per level of spells used in creating the base item</p>
<p><strong>Capability Time Costs:</strong> For these cost calculation purposes, a capability refers to an enchanted ability or an imbedded spell. Basically, the time required for each capability is:
<ul>
<li> The first capability costs 1 week for each level of each spell cast for creating that capability.</li>
<li> The second capability costs 2 weeks for each level of each spell cast for creating that capability.</li>
<li> The third capability costs 3 weeks for each level of each spell cast for creating that capability.</li>
<li> etc.</li>
</ul></li></ol>
In order to obtain the lowest cost, the creating Alchemist can choose which capability is first, which is second, etc. For the lowest cost, make the capability with the highest cost the first, make the capability with the second highest cost the second, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Total Time Cost</strong> =<br />
1 wk per lvl of spells for the base item<br />
+ 1 wk per lvl of spells for 1st capability <br />
+ 2 wk per lvl of spells for 2nd capability <br />
+ 3 wk per lvl of spells for 3rd capability <br />
+ etc.
</blockquote><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A 50th level Alchemist wishes to make: Mithril hammer (requires a 15th lvl Work Mithril spell) of Orc-slaying (requires a 15th lvl enchantment spell as determined by the GM). It would take 30 weeks to finish: 15 weeks for creating the base item (i.e., the Mithril hammer assuming the material is available) and 15 weeks for the enchanted ability or Orc-slaying to be added.<br />
If he also wanted to imbed a Haste I spell (1 charge) in the hammer (requires the 6th lvl Haste I spell to be imbedded and a 13th lvl Imbed VI spell), it would cost him considerably more time:<br />
[15 weeks for the base item]<br />
+ [19 weeks for imbedding the Haste VI spell]<br />
+ [2 x 15 weeks for the Orc-slaying enchanted ability]<br />
= 15+19+30<br />
= 64 weeks<br />
Note that making the Orc-slaying ability the first capability would cost 15 + 15 + 2 x (19) or 68 weeks.
</blockquote><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The same 50th level Alchemist wishes to make a Dragon Bone Rod. (Requires a 20th lvl Work Organic True spell and a 10th lvl Make Rod spell.) He also wishes to imbed a Sudden Light spell. (Requires the 5th lvl spell to be imbedded and a 8th lvl Charge Rod spell.) He also wishes to <strong>enchant</strong> it to be a +2 spell adder (requires a 10th lvl General II spell) and <strong>enchant</strong> it to have a +10 combat bonus as a mace (requires a 8th lvl Weapon II spell). The cheapest total cost is:<br />
[30 weeks for the base item]<br />
+ [13 weeks for imbedding Sudden Light spell]<br />
+ [2 x 10 weeks for the +2 spell adder enchanted ability]<br />
+ [3 x 8 weeks for +10 wp. enchanted ability]<br />
= 30+13+20+24<br />
= 87 weeks
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Distributing Time Costs:</strong> A GM may wish to allow this time cost to be distributed over several Alchemists if they are all capable of casting all of the Alchemist spells involved in the creation process.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The hammer above: takes one Alchemist 64 weeks but would take 8 Alchemists working together 8 weeks—provided all of them could cast Work Mithril, had researched Orc-slaying, and knew the Imbed VI and Haste I spells.
</blockquote>
<h4>REQUIRED SPELL CASTING COSTS</h4>
<p>The spell casting cost is merely the spells and power points that are required to be cast to make a magic item. Remember, all of the spells required to make a magic item must be cast every day of every week required for creating the item.</p>
<h4>MATERIAL AND MONEY</h4>
<p>This factor is dependent upon the world system used, but usually making metal items requires a forge and the appropriate metal (some metals may be rare, expensive or unobtainable). Cloth items might require a loom, leather items might require the appropriate leather and tools, and potions might require special lab equipment. Money is only required as it is needed to obtain these materials and perhaps for the support of the Alchemist while he is working.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose the GM ruled that the Mithril hammer in the example above requires 1 pound of Mithril (i.e., the rest of the weight is a wood or metal shaft and a steel core). The Alchemist would have to obtain the pound of Mithril. If a Mithril piece (.25 oz) is worth 100 gold pieces, 1 pound of Mithril would be worth around 6400 gold pieces.

<h3><a name="SL_7.4.5">7.4.5 </a>Making “Artifacts”</h3>
<p>Certain magic items which could not be made using the rules included in <em>Spell Law</em> can be classified as “Artifacts.” Requirements for making an artifact could be: special ceremonies, special groups of individuals, special sites, special equipment, special material, sacrifices, etc.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.4.6">7.4.6 </a>Lord Research</h3>
<p>Lord research can be performed when a Pure spell user of Essence or Channeling (not Mentalism) reaches 25th level and has learned the appropriate list (Symbolic Ways for Channelers or Rune Mastery for Essence users) to 25th level. At that point he can use the <em>Lord Research</em> spell to “research magic items.” This type of research is heavily dependent on the world system being used, but we suggest the following guidelines.<br />
First, the assumptions is made that jewels have a very, very high concentration of essence locked within them. Lord researchers, with the proper equipment and care, can break down jewels and release their essence into other materials at hand, although they have little control over the end result of the process. Thus to perform lord research, an Essence user slowly feed jewels into a forge over the course of several weeks (or more) while casting the <em>Lord Research</em> spell at least three times a day. An Channeler is required to “sacrifice” their jewels to their god (the jewels are destroyed) while casting the <em>Lord Research</em> spell at least three times a day. In both cases, the essence locked in the jewels will be released and begin to concentrate in some nearby item.<br />
What form this released essence will take is impossible to determine until some time after the process is entirely completed. At that time, the GM should determine <strong>randomly</strong> what the newly created magic item actually does (its realm of power could be random). Keep in mind that its power and capabilities should be proportional to the number of weeks spent in casting Lord Research spells <strong>and</strong> the number (and value) of the jewels destroyed in supplying it with essence (note that the more essence a jewel has, the more valuable it would normally be).<br />
It is suggested that the GM draw up tables of magic items appropriate to his world and use them to determine what powers an item created in this way might have. We suggest that these tables be based roughly on the alchemical lists, although it is not our intention that other professions be given the same item making capacity as an Alchemist (i.e., an Alchemist can choose what he is making).</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.4.7">7.4.7 </a>Special Research</h3>
<p>Of course, special research rules may be instituted by the Gamemaster as he sees fit. We present a few which might be appropriate.</p>
<h4>LIMITING ALCHEMIST RESEARCH</h4>
<p>If a GM wishes to have specialized Alchemists in his game, he can limit such Alchemists to one of the three material creation lists and allow them two other base lists of their choice. This means that specialized Alchemists would become forgers (only inorganic, e.g., a Dwarf forger), potion makers (only liquid/gas, e.g., a classic Witch), or weaver/leatherworkers (organic). Alternatively Alchemists could be allowed two of the three lists.</p>
<h4>CREATION OF ITEMS BY NON SPELL USERS</h4>
<p>In certain mythologies, certain races (such as Dwarves) were excellent forgers but not spell users. To simulate this, a Gamemaster can allow certain trained individuals in these races to use the materials list (but not the imbedding list).</p>

<h2><a name="SL_7.5">7.5 </a>SPELL RESEARCH</h2>
<p>This section presents guidelines for spell research. This material is intended for GMs that do not use the <strong><em>RM Standard System</em></strong>, but it can also be used by <strong><em>RM</em></strong> GMs when other, more detailed guidelines are not avaiable.<br />
Spell research is the development of new spells to go on existing spell lists or new spells that do not fit on any existing list. Potentially, an entire new spell list might be researched by some powerful character, and the knowledge of it passed on to his friends and followers.<br />
In any comprehensive world system for a long-running campaign, attention must be paid to spell research. This is essential for explaining how spells are developed. Of course, the simplest solution to this is to say that spells come from the gods (or some other external force) and allow no research in terms of the game. If the material in this section should be ignored. The following sections contain some of the suggested rules for conducting research in conjunction with using <em>Spell Law</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.5.1">7.5.1 </a>Limitations</h3>
<p>The GM should first determine if the proposed spell is acceptable for his world system. He is the final authority on the inclusion of a researched spell into his game and should examine each prospective spell closely. He may wish to introduce his own spell lists or spells to be available for the characters and non-player characters in his game.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility to Research</strong> — Under these guidelines, only Pure and Hybrid spell users may conduct research. Semi spell users and Non spell users many not normally conduct spell research. This prohibition represents a definitive limit on the powers of characters not devoting themselves exclusively to the use of spells.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of Realm</strong> — The GM should determine the realm of the proposed spell, (i.e., is the spell an Essence spell, a Mentalist spell, a Clerical spell, or perhaps a Hybrid spell). The introductions to the various spell books are useful for this purpose, and it should be noted that certain concepts have been deliberately left off certain lists with this restriction in mind (e.g., Clerics do not throw lightning bolts).<br />
Normally, a character may not research a spell outside of his realm of magic. Hybrid spell users may research spells in either of their two realms, but they are severely limited in the power of the spells they can research that do not fit on their base lists (i.e., since they cannot easily learn other lists beyond level 10, they could not research such spells).</p>
<p><strong>Definition of List</strong> — If possible, each spell should be grouped with similar spells, according to their nature. After determining that the spell is acceptable and deciding which realm it fits into, the Gamemaster (with help from the researcher) should determine if the spell fits into an existing list. If it does, then this concept is relatively easy to research, provided the researcher already knows that spell list. If the spell concept does not fit into an exiting spell list, it indicates that research material in this area is going to be less easy to find and more time will have to be spent in learning the new spell.</p>
<p><strong>Determination of Spell Level</strong> — The GM must assign a level to the spell, based upon its power and the level of other spells of similar power that the spell user already knows or has available. Note that spells with exactly the same effect often have different levels for different professions and particularly for different realms. Of course, a character cannot research a spell that is of higher level than he is, nor may any character research a spell that he would not be able to learn if it were on a list. Specifically, if a spell fits into a spell list above 10th level and a hybrid wishs to learn it, he could not normally do so because he is not permitted to learn spells on that list above 10th level—assuming, of course, that the spell did not fit into his base lists.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.5.2">7.5.2 </a>Requirements For Spell Research</h3>
<p>After satisfying himself that the researcher can learn the spell desired, the GM must establish that the character has access to the research material necessary (which may well involve payment) and subsistence. Other activity should be severely curtailed (i.e., he should plan to spend at least 8-10 hours a day doing the research). The researcher may then proceed to do his studying; the total amount of time required is discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>Researching Spells on Known Lists</strong> — If the spell is on an existing spell list, and the researcher knows that spell list to the level the Gamemaster determines the spell to be, the amount of time shown by the following chart must be spent in research.</p>
<p><strong>Researching Spells NOT on Known Lists</strong> — If the spell to be researched is not on a known list, or the researcher does not know that list to a sufficient level, the time costs involved (derived from the chart below) are normally tripled.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_7.5.3">7.5.3 </a>Successful Research</h3>
<p>Upon completing the required research, the researcher rolls once on one of the “General” column of the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.1">Basic Attack Table 5.1</a>. Any non-failure result indicates that the spell has been successfully learned. The researcher now knows the spell (and only the researcher). He may teach it to an associate at one fourth of the original research cost in time for both him and his pupil. The Gamemaster may wish to eventually allow certain researched spells to become a part of the list system for his world.</p>

<h1><a name="SL_8">8.0 </a>How to Use Spell Law Without Rolemaster</h1>
<p>This section presents a set of guidelines for using <em>Spell Law</em> if you do not have access to the full <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong> system. Certain rules have been simplified or changed to make it easier to use for those unfamiliar with <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong>.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/DICE ROLLING CONVENTIONS" -->
<h2><a name="SL_8.1">8.1 </a>DICE ROLLING CONVENTIONS</h2>
<p>Each die used in <em>Spell Law</em> is a 10-sided die which gives a result between 0 and 9. If two of these dice are used, a variety of results can be obtained. However, results between 1 and 100 are the primary basis of <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong> (i.e., it is a “percentile” system).</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Dice can be obtained at your local game stores.
</blockquote>
<h4>PERCENTILE (“1-100”) ROLLS</h4>
<p><strong>1-100 Roll</strong> — Most of the rolls in Rolemaster are “1-100” rolls (also called “D100” rolls). To obtain a 1-100 result roll, two dice together—one die is treated as the “ten’ s” die and the other as the “one’s” die (designate before rolling, please). Thus a random result between 01 and 100 (a “00” is treated as 100) is obtained.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The GM asks a player to make a 1-100 roll. The two dice are rolled; the tens die is a “4” and the ones die is a “7.” Thus the result is “47.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Low Open-ended Roll</strong> — To obtain a “low open-ended roll” first make a 1-100 roll. A roll of 01-05 indicates a particularly unfortunate occurrence for the roller. The dice are rolled again and the result is subtracted from the first roll. If the second roll is 96-00, then a third roll is made and subtracted, and so on until a non 96-00 roll is made. The total sum of these rolls is the result of the low open-ended roll.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The GM asks a player to make a low open-ended roll, and the initial roll is a 04 . A second roll is made with a result of 97; so a third roll is made, resulting in a 03. Thus, the low open-ended roll that the GM requested is - 96 (= 04 - 97 - 03).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>High Open-ended Roll</strong> — To obtain a “high open-ended roll” first make a 1-100 roll. A roll of 96-00 indicates a particularly fortunate occurrence for the roller. The dice are rolled again and the result is added to the first roll. If the second roll is 96-00, then a third roll is made and added, and so on until a non 96-00 roll is made. The total sum of these rolls is the result of the high open-ended roll.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The GM asks a player to make a high open-ended roll, and the initial roll is a 99. A second roll is made with a result of 96; so a third roll is made with a result 04. Thus, the high open-ended roll that the GM requested is 199 (= 99 + 96 + 04).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Open-ended Roll</strong> — An open-ended roll is both high open-ended and low open-ended.</p>
<h4>NON-“1-100” ROLLS</h4>
<p><strong>1-10 Roll</strong> — In instances when a result (roll) between 1 and 10 is required, only one die is rolled. This gives a result between 0 and 9, but the 0 is treated as a 10. Such a roll is referred to as “1-10” or “<dfn>D10</dfn>.”</p>
<p><strong>1-5 Roll</strong> — Roll one die, divide by 2 and round up (“<dfn>D5</dfn>”).</p>
<p><strong>1-8 Roll</strong> — Roll one die; if the result is 9 or 10, reroll until a 1 to 8 result occurs (“<dfn>D8</dfn>”).</p>
<p><strong>2-10 Roll</strong> — Roll two dice, divide each result by 2 (round up), and
then add the two results to obtain the “2-10” (“<dfn>2D5</dfn>”) result.</p>
<p><strong>Other Required Rolls</strong> — Any other required rolls are variants of the above.</p>
<h4>UNMODIFIED ROLLS (UM)</h4>
<p>Certain results on some rolls indicate an immediate effect and no modifications are considered. These rolls are marked on the appropriate charts with a UM. For example, all spell attack rolls of 01-02 indicate immediate spell failure, regardless of target, caster, or any other considerations.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/REALMS OF POWER" -->
<h2><a name="SL_8.3">8.3 </a>REALMS OF POWER</h2>
<p>Spell usage falls into three separate realms each of which concerns a different source of the power required to cast a given spell <strong>and</strong> a different set of spell lists. Similar spells exist in more than one realm, but the source of the power for the spells is dependent on the realm from which that power comes. Except for the hybrid spell users, spell users can only use one of the realms of power. These realms of power are <span id="essene">Essence</span>, <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>, and <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>.</p>
<h4>CHANNELING</h4>
<p><span id="channeling">Channeling</span> is the power of the deities of a given world as channeled through their followers or other spell users. It is spiritual in nature and independent of the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. A spell user of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> draws directly on the power of his deity, even though this doesn’t “usually” require the conscious cooperation of the deity. Thus, as long as the spell user is using relatively subtle spells (e.g., healing, detection, etc.), spell casting is handled normally. More powerful and significant spells such as death spells and revival of the dead might require active consent of a deity, depending upon the world system being used by the Gamemaster.</p>
<blockquote id="restriction">
<strong>Restriction:</strong> Metal interferes with the drawing of power form deities, so no metal may be worn when casting or using a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell (any spell of this realm). In addition, only a small amount of metal may be <strong>carried</strong> on the person of a spell user of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> when casting or using spells; this should be determined by the Gamemaster dependent upon his would system.
</blockquote>
<h4>ESSENCE</h4>
<p><span id="essence">Essence</span> is the power that exists in everyone and everything of and on a given world. It has been known in other sources as the Tao, Magic, The Force, etc. A spell user of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> taps this power, molds it, and diverts it into his spells. Most of his powerful spells reflect this and are elemental in nature: fire, earth, water, wind, light, cold, etc.</p>
<blockquote id="restriction">
<strong>Restriction:</strong> The more inert material that is on the person of the spell user of <span id="essence">Essence</span>, the more difficult it becomes to manipulate the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. Thus, when casting or using an <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell no armor, heavy clothing, or helmet may be worn. When the cooperation of more than one party is necessary for the casting of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell, all parties must abide by the above restriction.
</blockquote>
<h4>MENTALISM</h4>
<p><span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> is the power of the <span id="essence">Essence</span> channeled through the mind of the spell user, who in effect acts as a very, very minor deity for these purposes. Thus, <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> is a very personal power and even the most powerful spells are usually limited by the senses and perceptions of the spell user. Similarly, his spells are usually limited to himself or to one particular target.</p>
<blockquote id="restriction">
<strong>Restriction:</strong> Any head covering interferes with the power of <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> spells, so no head covering (especially helmets) may be worn while casting a <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> spell.
</blockquote>
<h4>ARMS</h4>
<p><span id="general">Arms</span> is not a realm of magical power and is merely mentioned for completeness. Non spell users are classified as concentrating in this realm and are especially adept at armed combat and maneuvering.</p>

<p>Spell users are classified according to their realm of power and their profession. This is assumed to be based on training or aptitude in early life and thus a factor inherent in a “profession.” Many “professions” are described below; however, Gamemasters may wish to initiate others or use those of different systems. The professions mentioned below are discussed only in terms of their spell casting capabilities and most of their other capabilities are left to whatever character development system is being used.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.4.1">8.4.1 </a>Pure Spell Users</h3>
<p>Pure spell users are of professions which have concentrated solely on one realm of power. Thus, their spells are generally more powerful than those employed by other spell users.</p>
<p><strong>Animist</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Animist">Animists</a> are pure spell users of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> who have concentrated on spells which deal with living things (e.g., shamans or druids). Their base spells deal with plants, animals, nature in general, and weather.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>—<a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Clerics</a> are pure spell users of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> who have concentrated in spells which require the most direct power from their deities. Their base spells deal directly with life, communing with deities, summoning live creatures, protection from servants of opposing deities, and direct channeling from their own deities. These spell users are the most powerful of the spell users of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>, but they are also the most restricted in the sense of heeding the desires or alignment of their deity (to be determined by the Gamemaster).</p>
<p><strong>Illusionist</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Illusionist">Illusionists</a> are pure spell users of <span id="essence">Essence</span> who have concentrated in spells of misdirection and illusion. Their basic spells deal mainly with the manipulation of elements which affect the human senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, mental impulses, and the combination of these senses.</p>
<p><strong>Lay Healer</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Lay_Healer">Lay healers</a> are pure spell users of <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> who have concentrated on spells which heal people and animals. Their base spells deal with the specific healing of certain diseases and injuries: organs, blood, muscles, bones, and concussion hits.</p>
<p><strong>Magician</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Magicians</a> are pure spell users of <span id="essence">Essence</span> who have concentrated in the elemental spells. Their base spells deal mainly with elements: earth, water, air , heat (e.g., fire), cold (e.g., ice), and light (e.g., electricity).</p>
<p><strong>Mentalist</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist">Mentalists</a> are pure spell users of <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> who have concentrated on spells which deal with the interactions of minds. Their base spells deal with the detection of mental presence, mental communication, mind control, mind attack, mind merging, and sense control.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.4.2">8.4.2 </a>Hybrid Spell Users</h3>
<p>Hybrid spell users are of professions combining two realms of power. They can obtain the power of the most potent pure spell user only in a very restricted set of spells; however they are much more flexible in that they have access to two realms of power. When a hybrid spell user casts a spell he must abide by the restrictions of that realm of power (only); if he is casting a Mentalism spell, he cannot be wearing a helmet, etc. When casting one of the spells from his base lists he must abide by the restrictions of both realms.</p>
<p><strong>Healer</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Healer">Healers</a> are pure spell users of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> who have concentrated on spells of self-healing and the ability to take the injuries of others <em>upon themselves</em>. Thus, a healer could heal a person by taking the injury of the patient upon himself and then healing this injury gradually.</p>
<p><strong>Mystic</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mystic">Mystics</a> are hybrid spell users who combine the realms of <span id="essence">Essence</span> and <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>. They have concentrated on subtle spells of misdirection and modification. Their base spells deal with personal illusion as well as the modification of matter.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Sorcerer">Sorcerers</a> are hybrid spell users who combine the realms of <span id="essence">Essence</span> and <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>, having concentrated on spells of destruction. Their base spells deal with the specific destruction of animate and inanimate material.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.4.3">8.4.3 </a>Semi spell Users</h3>
<p>Semi spell users combine a realm of power with the realm of <span id="general">Arms</span>. Members of these professions can only throw spells of limited potency, but are fairly adept in the use of arms.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Bard">Bards</a> are Semi spell users who combine the realm of <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> with the realm of <span id="general">Arms</span>. Their base spells deal with sound, lore, and item use.</p>
<p><strong>Dabbler</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Dabbler">Dabblers</a> are Semi spell users who combine the realm of <span id="essence">Essence</span> with the realm of <span id="general">Arms</span>. Their base spells deal with stalking, hiding, and other subterfuge activities.</p>
<p><strong>Magent</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magent">Magents</a> are Semi spell users who combine the realm of <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> with the realm of <span id="general">Arms</span>. Their base spells deal with intrigue and information gathering.</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monks</a> are Semi spell users who combine the realm of <span id="essence">Essence</span> with the realm of <span id="general">Arms</span>. Their base spells deal with personal movement and the control of their own body and mind, while their arms capabilities concentrate in unarmored, unarmed combat.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladins</a> are Semi spell users who combine the ream of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> with the realm of <span id="general">Arms</span>. Their base spells deal with combat, healing and service to their deity.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Ranger">Rangers</a> are Semi spell users who combine the realm of Channeling with the realm of Arms. Their base spells deal with operating in the outdoors and manipulating the elements (weather).</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.4.4">8.4.4 </a>Non spell Users</h3>
<p>Members of these professions have no inherent magical realm of power, and thus can only learn spells at great effort and cost (if at all, according to the Gamemaster’s discretion). Even then their spells are of very limited potency. If a non spell user does learn to cast spells, he is restricted to spells from one realm only. He makes his choice of realm during his adolescence development.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighters</a> are the primary arms specialists. Fighters will find it easy to develop a variety of different weapons and to wear heavier types of armor. They are less skilled than other non spell users in maneuvering and manipulating mechanical devices such as locks and traps (though they are still superior in those areas to spell users) and have the greatest difficulty in learning anything connected with spells.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Rogue">Rogues</a> are characters with some expertise in thiefly abilities and more specialized knowledge of arms than that possessed by Fighters. Normally a Rogue will be almost as good as a Fighter with one weapon of his choice. The cost of developing his thiefly skills will generally not allow him to be as good in these areas as a Thief, but his flexibility is unmatched by either profession.</p>
<p><strong>Thief</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Thief">Thieves</a> are specialists at maneuvering and manipulating. They have the easiest time learning mechanical skills such as picking locks and disarming traps and are fairly good at picking up weapons skills. Thieves are also unusually adept at Stalking and Hiding, Climbing and Perception. They rarely wear heavy armor, although armor does not especially harm the exercising of their professional abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Warrior Monk</strong> — <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monks</a> are experts at maneuvering and martial arts. Warrior monks can learn to use normal weapons, although not as easily as others of this realm; they prefer to utilize unarmed combat using the special <em>Arms Law</em> Martial Arts attack tables.</p>

<h2><a name="SL_8.5">8.5 </a>SPELL LISTS</h2>
<p>One of the basic aspects of this system is the use of spell lists and experience levels (or just levels). This section covers the use of Spell Law spell lists.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> An experience level is an abstract measure of the capabilities of a fantasy role playing character. This “level” is a factor determined by the character system being used by the Gamemaster. For systems not normally using levels, the Gamemaster may have to make up some measure of power (i.e., skills, talents, etc.) to rank his characters within a level system that defines level 0 as a young townsman and level 20 as a “Lord” in his respective profession.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_8.5.1">8.5.1 </a>Concept and Description</h3>
<p>A spell list is an ordering of spells based upon the correlation of spell level, intricacy of the spell and potency of the spell. All spells in a list have common characteristics and attributes, although each may have vastly different effects and applications. Spell lists are learned in stages, as the character progresses in experience, knowledge and power. It is quite often the case that a character has learned a list only to a certain level. In such a case, the character would know, and potentially be able to cast, all the spells on that list up to the level to which the list was known. The spell user gains the ability to cast these spells when his experience level is greater than or equal to the level of each spell.<br />
If there is no spell on a list at a given level, it signifies that no new spell ability is gained from knowledge of that list at that level.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> A spell user who learns a spell list or part thereof immediately acquires the ability to use the spells he now knows (of his level or below).
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_8.5.2">8.5.2 </a>Classifications</h3>
<p>Spell lists are classified according to their realm of power and availability to certain professions.</p>
<h4>BASE SPELL LISTS</h4>
<p>There are six Base spell lists for each spell user profession. These lists may only be learned by members of that profession. These spell lists represent professional specialties.</p>
<h4>CLOSED SPELL LISTS</h4>
<p>Closed spell lists involve the deepest and most powerful concepts common to each realm of magic, requiring tremendous dedication and specialization to master or learn at all. Pure spell users may learn the use of closed lists in their realms. Hybrid spell users may, with some difficulty and limitations, learn the use of closed spell lists in either or both of their two realms of power. Semi spell users and non spell users may never learn closed spell lists of any realm.</p>
<h4>OPEN SPELL LISTS</h4>
<p>Open spell lists involve the easiest concepts to master in each realm of power, although considerable dedication and research is required to learn their use. Any profession which has the realm of power as their own may learn the open lists of that realm. Hybrid spell users may learn the open spell lists associated with both of their two realms if they so desire.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.5.3">8.5.3 </a>Learning Lists</h3>
<p>Spell users learn lists up to and including certain levels by choosing “portions.” This is the crucial point in this system and must be carefully considered by the Gamemaster. Allow too many portions and spell lists are obtained too easily; too few portions and not enough flexibility is obtained. The suggested number of “portions” is one per experience level for pure and hybrid spell users (with a very small chance of one more—this chance should be dependent upon the effort spent leaning the list; their aptitude, time, research, etc., might affect the chance). It is suggested that Semi spell users be given a chance at one portion per level (25-50%) and perhaps a very, very slim chance (5%) for non spell users making a special effort. No spell user may select a portion from a list outside his own realm (for this purpose non spell users should choose a realm at level one).</p>
<h4>TYPES OF PORTIONS</h4>
<p>A portion, when chosen, allows the character to learn some of the spells on a single spell list. From one to ten new spells may become known to the spell user for each portion he chooses (dependent upon the level and profession of the spell user, the list on which the portion is chosen, and the prior knowledge of that list that the spell user had). Remember that the spell user does not gain the ability to cast these spells until he reaches their level, and that even then he must abide by all of the normal restrictions for casting spells. There are five types of “portions” that may be made. Generally, a profession will be restricted to using certain types of portions on certain types of lists (reflecting the relative difficulty of learning these lists). Certain professions cannot choose certain types of portions at all, and others may be restricted from choosing certain types of spells or spells beyond a certain level.</p>
<p><strong>“A” Portion:</strong> An “A” Portion includes all spells on the list up to and including level 5 (1-5th level).</p>
<p><strong>“B” Portion:</strong> A “B” Portion includes all spells on the list up to and including level 10 (1-10th level).</p>
<p><strong>“C” Portion:</strong> A “C” Portion can only be learned if an “A” Portion has already been learned for the spell list and the spell user is level 5 or higher. (In effect, he can already cast the spells of lower level than the ones he is attempting to learn). A “C” Portion includes all spells on the list up to and including level 10 (5-10th level).</p>
<p><strong>“D” Portion:</strong> A “D” Portion can only be learned if a “B” Portion has already been learned for the spell list and the spell user is level 10 or higher. A “D” Portion includes all spells on the list through level 20 (10-20th level).</p>
<p><strong>“E” Portion:</strong> An “E” Portion can only be learned if the spells on the list have already been learned to level 20 (through a “B” Portion and a “D” Portion previously learned). This Portion includes a single 25th, 30th or 50th level spell. All spells of lower level on this list must have already been learned (including the 25th level spell if the 30th level spell is the one being learned, or both of the above if a 50th level spell is the one to be learned). In addition, the spell user must be at least the same level as that of the spell being learned.</p>
<h4>PORTIONS AVAILABLE</h4>
<p>A spell user may only learn certain “portions” of spell lists (see above), dependent upon the “portions” (see above) he may make. These restrictions are summarized in the following chart:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Base List</th><th>Open List</th><th>Closed List</th></tr>
<tr><th>Pure Spell Users</th><td>B, D, E</td><td>B, D</td><td>B, D</td></tr>
<tr><th>Hybrid Spell Users</th><td>B, D, E</td><td>B</td><td>A, C</td></tr>
<tr><th>Semi Spell Users</th><td>B, D, E</td><td>A, C</td><td>—</td></tr>
<tr><th>Non Spell Users</th><td>—</td><td>A</td><td>—</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The ability to choose a portion listed for non spell users is meant to be an upper limit to their spell casting abilities, and the GM may find it advisable to curb even this potential. Remember that the restrictions on casting a spell must always be taken in to account, even after the spell is known and the caster has reached the necessary level.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a Magician reaches 26th level, and knows one of his base lists to level 20, one of his closed lists to level 20 and another to level 10. With one choice he can (a) learn a new spell list up to and including 10th level, (b) learn the 25th level spell on the base list he already knows to 20th level, or (c) learn the 11th–20th level spells on the second closed list (the one he already knows to 10th level). Note that because the other closed list is not a base list, he could not learn its 25th spell as a type “E” portion.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_8.5.4">8.5.4 </a>Extra Base Lists</h3>
<p>A pure spell user may select any four lists in his realm to be classified as base lists along with those normally associated with his profession (i.e., he may learn type “E” portions in these four additional lists). These lists may vary from character to character, but they must be picked when a character starts play and cannot be changed thereafter.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> We strongly suggest that these additional base lists only be chosen from the open and closed lists from the spell user’srealm,andnotfromthebaselistsofotherprofessions.
</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/CASTING SPELLS" -->
<h2><a name="SL_8.6">8.6 </a>CASTING SPELLS</h2>
<p>Once a list is known (i.e., learned) to a given level, a spell user can cast those spells he knows at his level or lower. Normally, however, a spell user is restricted in how long it takes to cast a spell and how many spells he can cast before resting.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.6.1">8.6.1 </a>Casting Capabilities</h3>
<p>The number of spells which can be cast by a character is dependent upon his power points (PPs) and the level of the spells cast. The number of power points expended to cast a spell is equal to the level of the spell (e.g., a 5th level spell costs 5 power points to cast). Power points, once used, can be only be regained by a period of sleep or meditation (usually around 8 hours).</p>
<h4>INHERENT CAPABILITIES</h4>
<p>Each spell user has a number of power points based upon his experience level and one of his stats . For a character of extraordinary faculties it could be as high as three or four power points for each experience level. (The <em>Stat Bonus Chart</em> summarizes the number of power points per level a character has available.) The applicable stat is based upon the character’s realm of power as follows (hybrid spell users should average the stat from their two realms of power):</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Realm</th><th>PP Stat</th></tr>
<tr><td><span id="channeling">Channeling</span></td><td>Intuition (wisdom, insight, luck)</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="essence">Essence</span></td><td>Empathy (intelligence, bardic voice)</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span></td><td>Presence (charisma, mental discipline)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>A GM who is using a 2-12 or a 3-18 stat system may use the appropriate column on the <em>Stat Bonus Chart</em> to obtain a character’ s power points per level. This is dependent upon his game’s character creation system, but for a character of extraordinary faculties it could be as high as three or four points.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a 15th level Cleric had an Intuition (Wisdom) of 92 (or 15 under a 3-18 system), then the Cleric would have 15 power points each day (1/level x 15th level). If his Intuition was 95 (or 16), then he would have 30 (2x15) PPs per day. If his Intuition was 100 (or 18), he would have 45 (3x 15) PPs per day. Assuming the last PP total (45) the Cleric could cast 3 of his highest level spells (15th); or 4 of his 10th level spells and a 5th level spell, or any combination of spell levels adding to 45.
</blockquote>
<p>Under certain circumstances, the GM may find it desirable to allow all spell users to have a minimum of one power point per level. (non spell users should not get this benefit.) Although spell users should be rare in any environment, they are among the most interesting characters to play in any fantasy game and a player wishing to have a spell using character may be severely handicapped if his PP stat is not high enough to give him inherent PPs.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Certain spells allow the transfer of PPs between characters; a character cannot receive more than twice his inherent PP total.
</blockquote>
<h4>BONUS ITEMS</h4>
<p>Certain magic items, bonus items, can enable characters to cast more spells per day.</p>
<p><strong>Power Point Multipliers</strong> — The power points of a spell caster with a power point multiplier are increased by the factor of the item. For example, a spell user with a “x2” item and an inherent power point total of 7 has a net PP total of 14 points.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Adders</strong> — Each +1 on a spell adder means that the owning spell user may cast (once) any one spell which he can normally cast, and not expend any PPs. These spell items can generally be used repeatedly, (after the same rest and/or meditation that enables a character to regain his own PPs).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose the 15th level Cleric in the example above had an Intuition of 92 (15 power points) and a +2 spell adder. He may cast any combination of spells he knows costing up to 15 PP and he may cast any 2 other spells that he knows (the levels of these two additional spells would not matter at all for the purposes of calculating the PPs he had expended). If the same Cleric had a “x2” power point multiplier, he would have 30 power points to expend in the normal manner.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong> — GMs must be very careful in handing out bonus items as they can distort the balance of the system. It is suggested that while +1 spell adders might be available to starting characters (like a weapon or armor for a Fighter), anything better should be relatively rare and expensive.
<ul>
<li> Only one bonus item should be usable by any one character between rest periods (possession of 2 “x2” PP multipliers doesn’t multiply your spell points by 4).</li>
<li> Bonus items should be usable by only 1 character per day. </li>
<li> Bonus items should be required to be held (or at least worn) when used (e.g., a Magician would have to carry his wand in his hand if that were his bonus item).</li>
<li> It is also suggested that bonus items be restricted to working in only one realm of power, except for hybrid spell user bonus items.</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>HYBRID POWER POINTS</h4>
<p>Inherent power points for hybrid spell users are obtained by averaging the key mental statistics for their two realms of power, and then using that to look up the PPs per level from the Stat Bonus Chart. A hybrid spell user can still utilize only one bonus item between periods of rest, but he can use an item from either of his realms of power. However an item keyed to only one realm will only work on spells from that realm, so a hybrid spell user would need a special item keyed to his combination of realms to use the bonus on his base spells. Such an item will work on spells from either of his realms and for any spell user of his profession. If a multiplying item from one of the two realms involved is being used by the hybrid, only the power points he naturally had available could be used outside that realm.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a 10th level Mystic (a hybrid of Essence and Mentalism) had an Empathy (Intelligence) of 91 (or 15 on 3-18) and a Presence (Charisma) of 97 (or 16). He would average the 91 and 97 to get a 94. (If 3-18 stats are being used, it is suggested that they be converted to the appropriate percentage stats and averaged in that form to yield “pseudo stat” for the determination of power points available.) His 94 average indicates he has 1 PP per level for a total of 10 PPs, which he might use to cast any spell he knew and could normally cast.<br />
This same Mystic could use a +3 spell adder for Essence to cast an additional 3 Essence spells. He could not use this spell device to cast his base spells or any Mentalism spells he knew, although he could use his inherent PPs in those areas.<br />
If he had a “x2” multiplier for Mentalism, he could use his inherent 10 points for any of his spells, but the extra 10 PPs from the multiplier could only be used for Mentalism spells. (If he wanted to use this spell device, he could not at the same time use the one described above or any other, of course.)<br />
A +2 spell adder for a Mystic (Essence & Mentalism) would allow him to cast any 2 spells he knows.
</blockquote>
<h4>MISCELLANEOUS</h4>
<p>Various factors may be introduced to affect power points in a given situation or game. For example, proximity to a Cleric’s deity might result in increased power points, or areas of rich or poor Essence might exist on a world which would affect a Magician’s power points. This is a factor which is decided by the Gamemaster.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.6.2">8.6.2 </a>Time Required To Cast A Spell</h3>
<p>The time required to cast a spell will be described in terms of rounds. (We suggest 10 second rounds, but this may vary from game system to game system.) The time required to cast a spell is based on the level of the spell user and the spell he is trying to cast. Most spells become easier to throw as the caster becomes more familiar with them, a factor that is reflected in game terms by comparing his level to that of the spell being cast.<br />
During spell preparation, a spell caster must concentrate and be relatively inactive (10% of normal activity or movement allowed). On the round of spell <em>effect</em> (i.e., when it is actually “cast” or “thrown”) a spell caster may operate with 25% of normal activity (which means he may not cast another spell). If a caster is dropped, stunned, or killed during preparation, the spell is canceled but no power points are expended.<br />
Note that certain spells are instantaneous in effect and do not require preparation. Treat these as Class I spells (see below) regardless of the level of the caster. Instantaneous spells are marked as such on the spell lists and in the descriptions.</p>
<blockquote id="option">
<strong>Option:</strong> A Gamemaster may wish to allow 90% of normal activity (instead of 25%) for the caster of an instantaneous spell. If this option is chosen, the GM should still only allow one spell to be cast per round.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Class III Spells</strong> — Class III spells require 3 rounds to cast; two rounds of preparation, and one round for effect. Class III spells have a level equal to the caster, one level less, or two levels less (e.g., a spell user of level 7 would have all of his 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> level spells as Class III spells).</p>
<p><strong>Class II Spells</strong> — Class II spells require two rounds to cast; one round of preparation, and on round for effect. Class II spells have a level of three less than the caster, four less than the caster, or five less than the caster (e.g., a spell user of level 7 would have all of his 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> level spells as Class II spells).</p>
<p><strong>Class I Spells</strong> — Class I spells require one round to cast; zero rounds to prepare, and one round for effect. Class I spells have a level of at least 6 less than the caster (e.g., our hypothetical level 7 spell user would have all his 1<sup>st</sup> level spells as class one spells, when he advanced to 8<sup>th</sup> level, his 2<sup>nd</sup> level spells would have become class I spells too, etc.). All instantaneous spells are considered to be Class I spells regardless of the level of the caster.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.6.3">8.6.3 </a>Casting Spells From Items</h3>
<p>When an imbedded spell is cast from an item, three things must be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>First</strong>, the character using the item must be able to use such an item. A spell user may automatically use any rune or item which he creates (i.e., he need not make an “item use” roll or a “read runes” roll). Once a character “learns to use” a reusable item (e.g., Wand, Rod, Staff, Daily item, etc.), he may freely use the item without having to make further “use items” rolls.</li>
<li> <strong>Second</strong>, the <em>level of effect</em> of the spell cast is the level of the spell itself (on whatever list it might appear) and not the level of the character using the item.</li>
<li> <strong>Third</strong>, the number of rounds required to prepare and cast the spell depends upon the level of the character as detailed in <a href="#SL_8.6.2">Section 8.6.2</a>. If the spell would normally be a Class II spell for him, he would require one round for preparation and one round for effect (exactly as if he were casting a Class II spell normally). If the character using the item is of a lower level than the spell being cast from the item, the spell is treated as Class III for preparation and effect timing.</li>
</ul>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/THE TACTICAL COMBAT SEQUENCE" -->
<h2><a name="SL_8.7">8.7 </a>THE TACTICAL COMBAT SEQUENCE</h2>
<p>This tactical combat sequence is based on a time frame of 10 second battle rounds and one minute turns (i.e., 6 rounds equal one turn). Normally, each combatant is allowed one attack roll per round, whether it be a spell, missile (bow and thrown fire), or melee. The rationale behind allowing missile and melee combatants only one roll every ten seconds is that, though he or she may actually swing or fire more often than this, only one effective attack is made in a round. The other swings/shots are assumed to be nullified by a shield, movement, a weapon, and/or fate.<br />
The basic principle to keep in mind is that each action takes a percentage of a round to complete. For example, one can view a physical attack as at least a 50% activity, casting a spell as a 75% activity, preparing a spell as a 90% activity, and movement as a 0-100% activity. Thus someone that casts a spell may not also make a physical attack.<br />
The time allotted to each round may vary with the game system and the preference of the GM, but the following sequence of action is recommended with rounds or turn segments of 6 to 10 seconds each.</p>

</ol>
<h4>SPELL ACTION PHASE (75% OR 90%)</h4>
<p>All combatants who will cast (or prepare) a spell during this round must specify any pertinent information to the GM (spell type, target, option to wait for opportunity fire, etc.).</p>
<ul>
<li> Movement/Maneuver is reduced to a maximum of 25% of normal for those who have cast a spell this round, and 10% for those who have prepared a spell.</li></ul>
<h4>SPELL RESULTS PHASE</h4>
<p>All “cast” (not prepared) spells specified in the previous phase are resolved simultaneously, unless an exception is indicated by the system or the GM. Effects are applied immediately, except spells held on opportunity.</p>
<ul>
<li> Movement/Maneuver is reduced to a maximum of 25% of normal for those who have cast a spell this round, and 10% for those who have prepared a spell.</li></ul>
<h4>SPELL ORIENTATION PHASE</h4>
<p>All combatants who performed unusual activities during the previous phase (e.g., Teleportation, etc.) must make an orientation roll to determine how well they have adapted themselves to their new surroundings. An exceptionally low roll might incapacitate them for the remainder of the round and prejudice their chance for successful action in the next round, while an exceptionally high roll would indicate the best possible result (intermediate values should be adjusted by the GM if necessary). The GM must determine what constitutes unusual activity within the context of the situation.</p>
<h4>FIRE PHASE–A (50%)</h4>
<p>All combatants who will fire during this phase must specify missile type, target/target area, and any other pertinent information. Users of self-reloading weapons (e.g., usually automatic/ semi-automatic projectile weapons) are able to fire in both this and Fire Phase B. Users of missile (bow) weapons and thrown weapons may fire in either phase, but only one. Exception: theoretically a character with a throwable weapon in each hand may throw one in Fire Phase (A) and one in Fire Phase (B).</p>
<ul>
<li> Spell casters/preparers may not fire.</li>
</ul>
<h4>FIRE RESULT PHASE–A</h4>
<p>All missile attacks specified in the previous phase are resolved simultaneously, unless an exception is indicated. All results are applied immediately. In the subsequent phases, all Phase–A firers have 50% of their activity left and thus may:</p>
<ul>
<li> Move/maneuver at 50% of normal.</li>
<li> Fire normally in Fire Phase (B) (self-reloading weapons only).</li>
<li> Melee with a -50 mod to OB.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MOVEMENT/MANEUVER PHASE (0-100%)</h4>
<p>All combatants in play may move up to the maximum of their movement allowance (depending on any activity engaged in during the earlier phases, and the movement system being used).</p>
<ul>
<li> Normally, drawing a weapon takes 20% of normal activity while changing weapons takes 50% of activity.</li>
<li> Dropping a weapon and drawing one takes 25% of activity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>FIRE PHASE–B</h4>
<p>Same as Fire Phase–A, except that a character may not fire if he has done any of the following this round:</p>
<ul>
<li> Cast/prepared a Spell.</li>
<li> Fired in Fire Phase–A and moved/maneuvered.</li>
<li> Moved/maneuvered more than 50% of normal allowance.</li>
<li> Been incapacitated and/or failed an orientation or maneuver roll.</li>
</ul>
<h4>FIRE RESULT PHASE–B</h4>
<p>The same as Fire Result Phase–A.</p>
<h4>MELEE PHASE (50%-100%)</h4>
<p>All characters may make a melee attack except those who have used more than 50% of their activity for the round. That is, they may not have done any of the following this round:</p>
<ul>
<li> Cast or prepared a spell.</li>
<li> Fired in Fire Phase–A and moved/maneuvered.</li>
<li> Moved/maneuvered and fired in Fire Phase–B.</li>
<li> Fired in Fire Phase–A and fired in Fire Phase–B.</li>
<li> Moved/maneuvered more than 50% of normal allowance.</li>
<li> Been incapacitated and/or failed an orientation or maneuver roll.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MELEE RESULT PHASE</h4>
<p>Within each group of combatants attempting to melee attack each other, attacks are resolved in the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li> Determine order in which combatants will attack by comparing initiative (quickness, and other factors, depending on circumstance); see <a href="#SL_5.6">Section 5.6</a>.</li>
<li> First combatant attack and result are applied immediately.</li>
<li> Second combatant, third combatant, etc., attack and apply results in order.</li>
<li> First combatant attacks with any usable second weapon, if any (e.g., he entered melee with a weapon in each hand, he is hasted, etc.).</li>
<li> 2nd, 3rd combatants, etc., attack with any 2nd weapon.</li>
</ol>
<h4>FINAL ORIENTATION PHASE</h4>
<p>In the judgment of the GM, any combatant who has been under significant pressure (e.g., surprise), or has made an unusual maneuver may be required to make an orientation roll, which may affect his ability to act in the next round.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.7.2">8.7.2 </a>EXCEPTIONS</h3>
<h4>OPPORTUNITY ACTION</h4>
<p>Combatants may plot <em>opportunity action</em> if they wish to perform a combat activity in a following phase of the current round or a following round. For example, a combatant may wish to withhold casting a spell until he sees who is moving where, and then cast. Opportunity action is announced during the correct phase for the desired action. Movement restrictions apply as if the combatant had actually performed the action during the correct phase. A combatant who has planned opportunity action can take no other action (except reduced movement) until the action is performed or canceled. Opportunity action occurs first in a phase, unless otherwise indicated by the GM.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> During the spell phase, a combatant with a prepared spell announces opportunity spell casting. He may then cast the spell in any of the following phases of this and following rounds. Until he casts the spell, he may neither melee, fire, nor make maneuvers. He is also reduced to 25% of his normal movement until the round after he casts the spell or until he cancels this opportunity action. During a fire phase of some following round, a character attempts to fire a bow. The spell user who has planned opportunity fire now casts his spell, resolving it before the bow is fired. If the bowman is incapacitated, the bow attack will not occur.
</blockquote>
<h4>OPPORTUNITY FIRE</h4>
<p>A combatant may claim Opportunity Fire during any phase of the combat round that he would normally be able to fire, and does not (see above). He may then fire normally during a subsequent phase of the same round or a following round (and would resolve his fire before other combatants). Opportunity Fire must be claimed against a known foe (or group of foes in the same location). It may also be claimed against a terrain feature or specific area (like a window, portal, the corner of a building, etc.).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Aurum is in combat with several minions of Traegon. During Fire Phase–A, he claims Opportunity Fire on a specific minion he knows is hiding behind a big rock. During the Movement and Maneuver Phase of the next round, the minion breaks from cover and tries to run to a gully where all of his buddies are. He never makes it; Aurum throws his dagger during the Movement and Maneuver Phase and drops him.
</blockquote>
<p>Movement is restricted to 25% of normal until the action is taken or canceled. A combatant who has declared Opportunity Fire may take no other action (except reduced movement) until the Opportunity Fire is performed or canceled. Opportunity Fire occurs first in any given phase unless otherwise indicated by the GM. No character may fire more than once in a given phase.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Assume the same situation as given in the example above. However, this time the minion steps out from behind the rock during the Movement and Maneuver Phase, but Aurum holds his Opportunity Fire. The next phase of the combat round is Fire Phase (B). Aurum decides that he wants to take his shot now, and fires (i.e., throws) first. Aurum’s player also wants to take his normal Fire Phase (B) shot with the dagger in his other hand, but the GM indicates (quite correctly) that no combatant may fire twice in the same phase. Aurum’s player says that is unfair.The GM says(quite correctly) that Aurum’s player is unreasonable.
</blockquote>
<h4>OB PENALTIES FROM MOVEMENT/MANEUVER</h4>
<p>If a character moves/maneuvers and then fires in Fire Phase (B) or melees in Melee Phase, he takes an OB mod to that attack. The OB mod is -5 for every 5% moved/maneuvered. In order to fire or melee, the character must have moved/maneuvered less than 51% of his normal allowance and may not have performed any other activity.</p>
<h4>USING MISSILE FIRE WHILE IN MELEE</h4>
<p>Normally, a combatant cannot throw or fire missiles while engaged in melee. For these purposes, a combatant is engaged in melee if:</p>
<ol>
<li> A foe attacked him in the previous melee phase, <strong>and</strong></li>
<li> That foe is still within striking distance (i.e., usually within 5-10'), <strong>and</strong></li>
<li> That foe’s action for the current round is to melee the combatant.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="SL_8.7.3">8.7.3 </a>Orientation Rolls</h3>
<p>When required by the GM, a combatant must make an orientation roll to determine his degree of self-control and awareness. Roll an open-ended 1-100 roll and add the most applicable stat bonus (usually a “self-control” stat). Cross index the result on the Maneuver/Movement Chart. The result is the percentage chance that the character has of orienting on the situation. Failure means disorientation and no further action is allowed for that round. Success means that the combatant is under control and aware of the situation, and may take further action that he would normally be allowed.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a minion of Traegon sneaks up on Black Oak the Druid, who is preparing to cast a divination spell. During the final orientation phase, the GM directs Black Oak to make an orientation roll to see if he notices the minion sneaking up behind him. Because the minion made a successful maneuver (a stalking maneuver) to sneak up on Black Oak, the GM assigns a degree of difficulty of “Very Hard.” Black Oak’s roll will be modified by +15 for his good Self Discipline and by -20 because Black Oak is unusually unobservant when preparing spells. He rolls a 76 for a net maneuver roll of 71 (76 + 15 - 20). Cross-indexing on the Maneuver/Movement Chart, we get a result of “30.” This means that Black Oak only has a 30% chance of noticing the minion; Black Oak makes a second roll of 72 and thus is completely oblivious to the danger approaching him from the rear. The GM should not allow Black Oak to take any actions to react to the threat of the minion.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_8.7.4">8.7.4 </a>Movement Conflicts</h3>
<p>When two or more combatants attempt to perform conflicting movements or maneuvers (such as two characters who are headed for the same space), the GM may choose to resolve the conflict by having the combatants in question make maneuver rolls. If one character succeeds and the other fails, the result is obvious. Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li> The conflict can be considered a draw, and movement for the involved parties can be terminated at the point of conflict;</li>
<h5 align="center">or</h5>
<li> The GM can use a comparison of maneuver rolls (higher roll having choice of position) and by common sense. A combination of the two is possible, where one of the characters, due to position, might have an add to his maneuver roll, but phenomenal luck could still beat him.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases of conflicting movement, the GM will ultimately have to decide the outcome of the conflict. The maneuver rolls of the involved parties are intended to aid him in his decision.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.7.5">8.7.5</a>Canceling Action</h3>
<p>During a round an action declared by a combatant may be canceled before it would otherwise be resolved. A character who has canceled his action may perform one of the following alternative actions:</p>
<ul>
<li> Melee with half of his normal ability.</li>
<li> Move half his normal (not running) movement.</li>
<li> Make a maneuver modified by -30.</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternative action chosen <strong>must</strong> be performed when the other actions of that type are normally resolved.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.7.6">8.7.6 </a>Haste</h3>
<p>Certain spells will modify the normal turn sequence to some degree. The most common of these modifications will be Haste. A person who is hasted will basically have 200% normal activity, but must abide by the sequence restrictions. That is, whatever activity the person takes will have to occur in the proper phase (thus, a hasted person could not move, fight and then move again). A hasted person could fire a bow, move, and then melee, or attack twice in a melee phase (once at the beginning and once at the end).</p>
<ul>
<li> A hasted character may not fire more than twice a round.</li>
<li> Casting more than one spell/round is still prohibited.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Haste also has certain liabilities: e.g., a hasted character expends exhaustion points at double normal rate, a bleeding wound bleeds at double normal rate, all other wounds have a 25% chance of “bleeding” 1 point per round, etc.
</blockquote><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Spell Class</th><th>When takes effect</th><th>Remaining Activity</th></tr>
<tr><td>I</td><td>Spell Effects Phase</td><td>125%</td></tr>
<tr><td>II</td><td>Spell Effects Phase</td><td>35%</td></tr>
<tr><td>III</td><td>Next round</td><td>25% (next round)</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of a Class III spell prepared by a hasted caster, it should be treated as a Class I spell next turn (when it takes effect, and for the purposes of determining the movement allowed to the caster afterwards) whether the caster is hasted that round or not.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If the GM is prohibiting the casting of two spells in a round, as suggested, he may wish to prohibit the preparation of a 2nd spell in the same round another is cast.
</blockquote><blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Both Speed and Haste spell may begin their effect in the round after they are cast.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_8.7.7">8.7.7 </a>Armor</h3>
<p><strong><em>Rolemaster (RM)</em></strong> armor is the basic protective capability assigned to the material covering the body, and is divided into five categories of four Armor Types (ATs) each (a total of 20 types).</p>
<div align="center">Cloth-Skin Base<br />
Soft Leather Base <br />

<h4>ARMOR PENALTIES</h4>
<p>Due to its weight and constrictive nature, there are penalties associated with wearing armor while attempting to maneuver, defend, and throw/fire missiles.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5522/RESOLVING SPELL EFFECT" -->
<h2><a name="SL_8.8">8.8 </a>RESOLVING SPELL EFFECT</h2>
<p>Once a spell is cast, the effect of the spell must be resolved. In many cases the results are automatic, but when the target is a living creature or unusual object, various results can occur. These results range from the spell failing to operate to the spell being overwhelmingly successful.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.8.1">8.8.1 </a>Non-Attack Spells</h3>
<p>Non-attack spells include those which cannot adversely effect an opponent. These spells are indicated in the spell descriptions and include all spells marked: informational, defensive, etc. When a non-attack spell is cast, the caster makes a 1-100 roll:</p>
<ul>
<li> If the roll is 03-00, the spell succeeds.</li>
<li> If the roll is 01-02, the spell fails. A high open-ended roll is made and applied to the non-Attack Section of the Spell Failure Table 6.6; using either the Information column (if the spell is trying to determine information) or the Other column (for all other non-attack spells). Finally, the result is immediately applied to the spell or to the caster (whichever is indicated by the result). If a spell cast from an item “fails,” the failure is handled just like any other spell failure.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="SL_8.8.2">8.8.2 </a>Basic Attack Spells</h3>
<p>Basic Attack spells include all spells which are not non-attack spells (how surprising) and which are not “elemental attack spells.” Usually a Basic Attack spell is directed at a target that is a creature (or an unusual object) that gets to attempt to resist the effects of the spell.<br />
Basic Attack spells are resolved by the caster making an attack roll (not open-ended) and then applying the results to a Resistance Roll (open-ended) made by the target (or Gamemaster). This net Resistance Roll (RR) will indicate if the spell has affected the target.</p>
<h4>BASIC ATTACK ROLLS</h4>
<p>The Basic Attack Roll (BAR) is <strong>not</strong> open-ended and represents the effectiveness of the caster’s spell.</p>
<h4>UNMODIFIED ROLLS</h4>
<p>A BAR of 01-02 or 96-00 indicate an immediate effect and no modifications are applied. These rolls are marked on the Basic Attack Table with a “UM” (for “Unmodified”).</p>
<ul>
<li> An unmodified roll of 01-02 indicates automatic spell failure.</li>
<li> An unmodified roll of 96-00 indicates a higher than normal Resistance Roll modification.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MODIFICATIONS TO THE BASIC ATTACK ROLL</h4>
<p>If the original roll was not 01-02 or 96-00, the following modifications are added to the Basic Attack Roll to obtain the Modified BAR. If the BAR thus modified is less than 03, the Modified BAR is 03. If the modified roll is greater than 95, the Modified BAR is 95.</p>
<p><strong>Level of Caster</strong> — If the caster is a pure spell user or a hybrid spell user, the level of the caster is added to the BAR. Non spell users and Semi spell users do not get this bonus. This bonus also applies if the spell is being cast from an item by a pure or hybrid spell user.</p>
<p><strong>Race or Unusual Material</strong> — Certain creatures and races are especially hard to enchant (e.g., Demons or Dwarves). These creatures should be given a modification by the Gamemaster based upon his world system. Similar modifications should be given to certain unusual materials (e.g., Mithril or Adamant) and magic items.</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> — There is a modification to the BAR based upon the distance from the caster to the target. The modifications are provided below and on the Basic Attack Table:
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Range</th><th>BAR Modification</th></tr>
<tr><td>Touching</td><td>+30</td></tr>
<tr><td>0' – 10'</td><td>+10</td></tr>
<tr><td>11' – 50' </td><td>+0</td></tr>
<tr><td>51' – 100' </td><td>-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>101' – 300' </td><td>-20</td></tr>
<tr><td>more than 300'</td><td>-30</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p><strong>Items and Spells</strong> — Some spells and magic items may modify the BAR. These are variable and usually depend upon the specific spell and the properties of the magic item.</p>
<p><strong>Cover and Situation</strong> — Certain situations can result in modifications being given by the Gamemaster. Some suggested modifications are indicated below.</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Situation</th><th>Mod</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><td>Full Cover</td><td> -20 </td><td>Detected but not sighted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Partial Cover</td><td> -10 </td><td>Less than 1/2 target sighted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Static Target</td><td> +10</td><td>No cover, target is surprised or prone</td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a 12th level Magician wants to cast a sleep spell on a 9th level Fighter, who is 55' away. The Magician gets to add +12 for his level and suffers a -10 for range, giving a total modification of +2 to the Basic Attack Roll. If the Fighter was behind a tree, the Gamemaster might give him -10 for partial cover, changing the net modification total to -8. So a roll of 72 would give a Modified BAR of 64.
</blockquote>
<h4>BASIC ATTACK TABLE</h4>
<p>The Basic Attack Table has nine columns based upon the effect certain armor has on the three realms of power. To find the appropriate column, first find the heading for the realm of power of the spell being cast (Essence, Channeling, or Mentalism). Then choose one of the three columns under that realm which applies to the target.</p>
<h4>EFFECTS OF THE BASIC ATTACK ROLL</h4>
<p>The Modified BAR is cross-indexed with the appropriate column and the spell result is read off the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.1">Basic Spell Attack Table 5.1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Failure</strong> — An “F” Result indicates that the spell has failed. A high open-ended roll must be made and applied to the Attack Section of the Spell Failure Table 6.6 (using the Force column). The result is immediately applied to the spell or caster (as indicated by the result). If a spell cast from an item “fails,” the failure is handled just like any other spell failure.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance Roll Modification</strong> — A result of a positive or negative number indicates a result which must be added to the target’s Resistance Roll.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Assume the situation in the example above, but without the partial cover (net modification is +12 for level, -10 for range or +2 total). Assume the Fighter is wearing leather armor.
If the Magician rolls 01-02, the spell fails automatically. If the Magician rolls a 03-10, the Modified BAR is between 05 and 12, which still indicates a spell failure. If the roll is 11-46, the Modified BAR would be between 13 and 48, resulting in a modification to the RR favorable to the Fighter. If the roll is 55-95, the Modified BAR is between 57 and 95 (96 and 97 would be treated as 95s) and would result in a modification to the RR unfavorable to the Fighter (the spell is particularly well cast). Of course, and unmodified roll of 96-100 would result in a very large modification to the RR.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_8.8.3">8.8.3 </a>Resistance Rolls</h3>
<p>If the spell has not failed, the target of a Basic Attack spell must make a Resistance Roll (RR). This roll represents the target’s innate resistance to the effects of the spell and may be modified by a number of factors. This roll is open-ended and thus represents the chance that the target may not be affected by a very powerful spell, as well as the chance that a target may fail to resist a very weak spell.</p>
<h4>MODIFICATIONS TO THE RESISTANCE ROLL</h4>
<p>Modifications to the RR are additions or subtractions to the RR which result in the Modified RR.</p>
<p><strong>Modifications From the BAR</strong> — The modification indicated by cross-indexing the Modified BAR with the appropriate target column is added to the RR.</p>
<p><strong>Stat Bonus</strong> — A stat bonus modification is added to the RR; this bonus is based upon the realm of the spell cast and one of the stats of the target. The stat bonus for a RR against a hybrid spell user’s base spells is obtained by averaging the stat bonuses for the two realms involved. The values of these modifications are given in the Stat Bonus Chart in <a href="#SL_8.2">Section 8.2</a>. The suggested stats are:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Realm of the Spell</th><th>Target’s RR Stat</th></tr>
<tr><td>Channeling</td><td>Intuition [wisdom]</td></tr>
<tr><td>Essence</td><td>Empathy [intelligence]</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mentalism</td><td>Presence [charisma]</td></tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Race</strong> — Certain races are unusually magic resistant and may be given a modification by the Gamemaster based upon his world system, (e.g., Demons and Dwarves).</p>
<p><strong>Items and Spells</strong> — Certain items or spells may give a target a modification to his RR. These modifications depend upon the item or specific spell.</p>
<p><strong>Willing Targets</strong> — Certain targets may submit themselves as willing participants in a spell, in such a case, the RR should be modified by -50, and the level of the target should be 1 for the purposes of the RR.</p>
<p><strong>Special Attack Spells</strong> — A few spells are very difficult to resist and have their own additional modification to any RR made against them (e.g., any RR versus Absolution on the Cleric Base list, Channels, is subjected to a special -20 “RR Mod”).</p>
<h4>THE RESISTANCE ROLL TABLE</h4>
<p>To use the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.10">Resistance Roll Table 5.10</a>, cross-index the attack level (usually the level of the caster) with the level of the target. If the Modified RR is greater than or equal to the result obtained by the cross-indexing, the target has resisted the spell. Otherwise, the target has not resisted the spell and suffers the results given in the description of that spell (Sections <a href="#SL_2">2.0</a>-<a href="#SL_4">4.0</a>).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The 12th level Magician in the examples above has rolled a 60, modified (+12 for level, -10 for range) to a 62. Cross-indexing 62 with the Leather Armor column on the Basic Attack Table we find that a RR modification of - 5 is the result. The Fighter rolls a 62 for his Resistance Roll. The BAR modification is -5 and the Fighter’s Empathy stat is 50 (stat bonus is +0). No items are affecting the spell (+0) and the Common Man Fighter is not of a particularly magic resistance race (+0). He is not a willing target (+0) and the spell being used is not particularly powerful (+0). So -5 is the only modification to his RR. His Modified RR is 57. Cross-indexing his level (9th) with the attack level (12th), we note that he needed a Modified RR of 57 or more to successfully resist the spell. So he does resist the spell; had he rolled a 61 or lower initially, he would have failed to resist the spell.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Minimum Result Spells</strong> — Certain spells also have minimum effects. These are applied even if a successful RR is made.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Hit Tables</strong> — Some spell attacks require a roll on one of the Critical Hit Tables. In these cases, the BAR and Resistance Rolls are made as usual, and, if the target fails his RR, the spell user casting the spell then makes an unmodified roll on the appropriate column of the chart indicated. (E.g., a target in the radius of a first round Stun Cloud on the Magician Base list, Wind Law, is subjected to a ‘C’ electricity critical if he fails his RR.) See <a href="#SL_8.8.6">Section 8.8.6</a> for details on resolving criticals.<br />
Normally, the caster rolls a separate critical for each affected target each round that the target is affected (i.e., for lingering spells like Stun Cloud); in some situations, the GM may decide to have a “group” critical roll for a number of targets in order to speed play.</p>
<p><strong>result / <em>#</em> failure</strong> — Certain spells will indicate a total result based upon the difference between the Modified RR and the result from the Resistance Roll Table. This difference, divided by the <em>#</em> (round off), indicates how many increments of the result are applied.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> If a target fails his RR by 47 against a Confusion spell (Mentalist Base list, Mind Assault), he will be paralyzed for 9 rounds because the Duration is “1 round / 5 failure” (47  ̃ 5 = 9.4 which rounds to 9).
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_8.8.4">8.8.4 </a>Elemental Attack Spells</h3>
<p>An elemental attack spell concentrates one of the raw forms of Essence (earth, water, air, heat, cold or light) into a physical attack on the target. Since such a spell concentrates elemental force to attack its target physically, the target is <strong>not</strong> entitled to a Resistance Roll. Each spell of this type has a separate attack table (Tables 5.2-5.8) differentiating its varying effects based upon the target’s Armor Type and mobility.</p>
<h3>Elemental Attack Rolls</h3>
<p>The Elemental Attack Roll (EAR) is an open-ended roll that represents the accuracy and potency of a caster’ s elemental attack spell.</p>
<h4>UNMODIFIED ROLLS</h4>
<p>An EAR of 01-02 or 96-00 may indicate an immediate effect and no modifications are applied. These rolls are marked on the elemental attack tables (5.2-5.8) with a “UM.”</p>
<ul>
<li> An unmodified roll of 01-02 indicates automatic spell failure.</li>
<li> An unmodified roll of 96-00 for Area spells (e.g., Cold Ball, Fire Ball, etc.) indicates a very severe attack result.</li>
<li> An unmodified roll of 00 for non-Area spells (e.g., Ice Bolt, Lightning Bolt, etc.) indicates a very severe attack result.</li>
<li> If an unmodified roll is not indicated, then rolls of 01-05 and 96-00 are treated as normal open-ended rolls (see <a href="#SL_8.1">Section 8.1</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>CASTER MODIFICATIONS TO THE EAR</h4>
<p>If the original EAR was not an unmodified result, the following Caster modifications are added to the EAR. These modifications are summarized in <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.9">Table 5.9</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caster Level</strong> — If the caster is a pure spell user or a hybrid spell user, his level is added to the EAR.</p>
<p><strong>Caster Agility</strong> — The caster’s Agility stat bonus may modify the EAR (see the Stat Bonus Chart in <a href="#SL_8.2">Section 8.2</a>). <em>This modification is not applicable to Area Spells</em> (e.g., <em>Cold Ball</em>, <em>Fire Ball</em>, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Directed Spells Skill Bonus</strong> — This is based upon the caster’s Directed Spells Skill with the spell being cast. <em>This modification is not applicable to Area Spells</em> (e.g., <em>Cold Ball</em>, <em>Fire Ball</em>, etc.).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A 25th level Magician has 10 Directed Spell skill ranks (+50 bonus) with Fire Bolt and 8 skill ranks (+40 bonus) with Ice Bolt. When he reaches 26th level he may develop another Directed Spell skill rank with the Fire Bolt, which will raise his bonus by +2 to +52, or he may increase his Ice Bolt skill ranks and increase that bonus by +5 (from +40 to +45). Of course he could choose to develop Directed Spell skill with another spell, which would give him a skill rank of 1 and a bonus of +5 with that spell (if he had not already developed any skill with it).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Range</strong> — There is a modification to the EAR based upon the distance from the caster to the target. These modifications range from +35 to -75 and are provided on the elemental attack tables (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.2">5.2</a>-<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.8">5.8</a>). The standard modifications are provided below:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Range</th><th>EAR Modification</th></tr>
<tr><td>0' – 10' </td><td>+35</td></tr>
<tr><td>11' – 50' </td><td>+0</td></tr>
<tr><td>51' – 100' </td><td>-25</td></tr>
<tr><td>101' – 200' </td><td>-40</td></tr>
<tr><td>201' – 300' </td><td>-55</td></tr>
<tr><td>300' – up</td><td>-75</td></tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Position</strong> — Certain situations can result in modifications being given by the GM; suggested values are given in <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-15.3">Table 15.3</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Items and Spells</strong> — Some spells and magic items may modify the EAR. These are variable and usually depend upon the specific spell and the properties of the magic item.</p>
<h4>TARGET MODIFICATIONS TO THE EAR</h4>
<p>These modifications are summarized in <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.9">Table 5.9</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Target Quickness</strong> — The target’s Quickness stat bonus may modify the EAR (see the Stat Bonus Chart in <a href="#SL_8.2">Section 8.2</a>). This only applies if the target is moving; stationary targets receive cover and position modifications rather than Quickness bonuses. The target’s Quickness bonus may be modified by the armor he is wearing.</p>
<p><strong>Shields & Helmets</strong> — A helmet and/or shield which faces the caster gives the target modifications as indicated below and on <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.9">Table 5.9</a>. <em>Shield modifications are not applicable to Area Spells</em> (e.g., <em>Cold Ball</em>, <em>Fire Ball</em>, etc.).</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Type</th><th>EAR Mod.</th><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>No Helmet</td><td>+5</td><td>—</td></tr>
<tr><td>Normal Helmet</td><td>+0</td><td>—</td></tr>
<tr><td>Full Helmet</td><td>-5</td><td>covers face</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wall Shield</td><td>-30</td><td>35-50 lb</td></tr>
<tr><td>Full Shield</td><td>-20</td><td>25-30 lb</td></tr>
<tr><td>Normal Shield</td><td>-15</td><td>15-20 lb</td></tr>
<tr><td>Target Shield</td><td>-5</td><td>5-10 lb</td></tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Cover and Position</strong> — At times, the target may be in an advantageous position. For example, partially behind a tree and this should be reflected in a subtraction from the EAR (to be determined by the GM). Note that, at times, the defender’s position may be so advantageous that he cannot be affected by the attack (use common sense). Some suggested modifications are indicated below and on <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.9">Table 5.9</a>.</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Situation</th><th>Mod</th><th>Notes (No Qu Bonus)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Full Cover</td><td> -60</td><td>Detected but not sighted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Partial Cover</td><td> -30</td><td>Less than half of target sighted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Static Target</td><td> +30</td><td>No cover, target is surprised or prone</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>DIRECTED SPELL SKILL</h4>
<p>By spending time and effort in practice and use, a caster may develop Directed Spell skill in using certain elemental attack spells. This is dependent upon the character development system used.<br />
At each level of experience, a spell caster may increase his Directed Spell skill with one elemental attack spell (that he can already cast) by one “skill rank” (his choice). This means his Directed Spell skill with any elemental attack spell is not a direct function of his level. The spell caster’s Directed Spell skill rank with each of these spells must be recorded.<br />
A spell user’s Directed Spell skill bonus with a specific spell is +5 for each of the first 10 skill ranks, +2 for each of skill ranks 11-20, +1 for every skill rank over 20.<br />
GMs employing this rule may want to allow extra development of Directed Spell skill through practice and/or research.</p>
<h4>AREA SPELLS</h4>
<p>Certain Elemental Attack spells are called Area spells (<em>Fire Ball</em>, <em>Cold Ball</em>, etc.). These spells attack all targets in their radius.<br />
Modifications to the EAR due to caster’s Agility, caster’s skill, and target’s shield <em>do not</em> apply; all other modifications do apply. In addition, there is a +20 EAR modification for any target at the center point (chosen by caster) of the spell’s effect.<br />
A GM may require only one EAR to be applied to all targets or individual EARs, whichever he deems appropriate for the given situation. If the GM decides on individual EARs, only the first could result in spell failure; a subsequent EAR that would normally result in spell failure is treated as a “no effect” result.</p>
<h4>RESULT DETERMINATION</h4>
<p>If the Modified EAR is less than 03, it is treated as 03. If the Modified EAR is greater than 95 for an Area Elemental Attack spell, it is treated as 95. If the Modified EAR is greater than 99 for an non-Area Elemental Attack spell, it is treated as 99.<br />
The Modified EAR is cross-indexed with the target’s Armor Type on the appropriate elemental attack table (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_5.2">5.2</a>-<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#5.8">5.8</a>). The results vary from spell failure to critical strikes as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Spell Failure</strong> — A “F” result indicates that the spell has failed. A high open-ended roll must be made and applied to the Attack Section of the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_6.6">Spell Failure Table 6.6</a> (using the Elemental column). The result is immediately applied to the spell or caster (as indicated by the result). If a spell cast from an item “fails,” the failure is handled just like any other spell failure.</p>
<p><strong>Concussion Hits</strong> — A number result (e.g., “8”) indicates the number of concussion hits the target receives. Each target is limited in the number of concussion hits that he can take. When this limit is passed, the target is unconscious (if living). He can take no further action until he is once again under the limit. Death may be caused if this limit is exceeded by a certain amount. The point at which death occurs is proportional to the combatant’s physical constitution, and depends on the system used in the game for deriving physical characteristics. The GM will have to decide on the point at which death results (e.g., 2 times the number of concussion hits causing unconsciousness could result in the victim’s death, or, alternatively, the number of concussion hits causing unconsciousness added to the victim’ s Constitution).</p>
<p><strong>Critical Strikes</strong> — A result of a number followed by a letter (e.g., “17B”) indicates: a number of concussion hits (see above) and a critical strike of a severity indicated by the letter (i.e., a severity of between ‘A’ and ‘J’).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> 8B indicates that the target takes 8 concussion hits and a critical strike of severity ‘B’. The type of critical strike depends on the spell and is printed on the appropriate elemental attack table (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.2">5.2</a>-<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.8">5.8</a>). For example, a Fire Bolt gives Heat criticals while an Ice Bolt gives Impact criticals and possibly Cold criticals.
</blockquote>
<h4>CRITICAL STRIKE TABLES</h4>
<p>The severity of a critical strike (or just critical) ranges from ‘A ’ (least severe) to ‘E’ (most severe) with letters ‘F’ through ‘J’ indicating multiple criticals as detailed below and on the individual elemental attack tables (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.2">5.2</a>-<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.8">5.8</a>).<br />
When a critical is indicated, a second (1-100, not open-ended) roll is then made and the result is cross-indexed with the severity of the critical (‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, or ‘E’). The results are immediately applied to the target; see <a href="#SL_8.8.6">Section 8.8.6</a>.<br />
Certain critical strikes fall in the range of ‘F’, ‘G’, ‘H’, ‘I’, or ‘J’. These results indicate two or three normal critical strikes to be applied to the target. A separate roll is made for each critical and all results are applied cumulatively. The number of critical strikes and their severity is given by the following table. This information along with the critical types are provided on each of the individual elemental attack tables (5.2-5.8).</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Critical Severity</th><th>Primary Critical</th><th>Secondary Critical</th><th>Tertiary Critical</th></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td> E</td><td>A</td><td>–</td></tr>
<tr><td>G</td><td> E</td><td>B</td><td>–</td></tr>
<tr><td>H</td><td> E</td><td>C</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>I</td><td> E</td><td>D</td><td>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>J</td><td> E</td><td>D</td><td>C</td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a 12th level Magician wants to cast a “Lightning Bolt” spell at a 9th level Fighter.<br />
Assume the Fighter is 55' away (-25) from the Magician and has normal Quickness (+0), a normal shield facing the Magician (-15), and a normal helmet (+0); for a total target EAR modification of -40.<br />
The Magician adds his level (+12) and his Direct Spell skill bonus (+10). (Lightning Bolt is a 10th level spell and he has been able to cast it for 2 levels, at each of which he developed a skill rank in Directed Spell skill for Lightning Bolt for a bonus of +5 per skill rank.) This gives a total caster EAR modification of +22.<br />
The net modification to the die roll is -18 (22 – 40). Assuming the Fighter is wearing a leather breastplate and greaves (AT 9) and the Magician rolls an EAR of 90, the Modified EAR is 72 (90 + -18). Cross-indexing the result with AT 9, we see the result is “7A” — the Fighter takes 7 concussion hits and an ‘A’ electricity critical. The critical result is obtained by making a 1-100 roll and crossindexing it with the ‘A’ column on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.2">Electricity Critical Strike Table 6.2</a>.<br />
Had the Magician gotten a little closer to the Fighter, he would have eliminated the unfavorable range modification (-25 at 55' goes to +0 at 50') and the net EAR would have been 97 (90 + 22 – 15) for a “17D” result.
</blockquote>
<h2>Large and Super Large Creatures</h2>
<p>Certain unusual creatures are so large and/or powerful that the normal critical strike tables are not used when they receive critical strikes. Unusual creatures are separated into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li> <em>Large Creatures</em> (Trolls, Giants, Demons, and Undead, etc.).</li>
<li> <em>Super Large Creatures</em> (Dragons, very powerful Demons, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category has its own critical strike table, which is consulted if a sufficiently severe critical strike is obtained against them. The roll for criticals against Large and Super Large creatures is high open-ended.</p>
<h4>LARGE CREATURE CRITICAL STRIKES</h4>
<p>Only critical strikes of severity ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, or ‘E’ affect Large creatures (i.e., ‘A’ severity criticals are ignored). A high open-ended roll is made and cross-indexed with the “Large Creature, Normal” column on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.5">Creature Critical Strike Table 6.5</a>, to obtain a result that is applied immediately. Note that the severity of the critical strike is irrelevant, except that it must be of ‘B’ severity or higher. This reflects the fact that such creatures present such a large target that they are much more difficult to seriously hurt.</p>
<h4>SUPER LARGE CREATURE CRITICAL STRIKES</h4>
<p>Only critical strikes of severity ‘D’ or ‘E’ affect Super Large creatures (i.e., ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ severity criticals are ignored). A high open-ended roll is made and cross-indexed with the “Super Large, Normal” column on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.5">Creature Critical Strike Table 6.5</a>, to obtain a result that is applied immediately.<br />
This table should be consulted of only for creatures such as Dragons, Dinosaurs, and the most powerful Demons.</p>
<h4>SLAYING CRITICALS</h4>
<p>Some Large and Super Large creatures are especially vulnerable to certain types of spell criticals (e.g., Metal Golems are likely to be relatively vulnerable to electricity criticals, Fire Dragons are likely to be relatively vulnerable to cold criticals, etc.). In such cases, if a Large or Super Large critical is to be resolved, use the appropriate “Slaying” column on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-6.5">Creature Critical Strike Table 6.5</a> instead of the “Normal” column.</p>
<h4>IMMUNE CREATURES</h4>
<p>Some creatures are immune to certain types of critical strikes (e.g., Fire Demons are likely to be immune to fire spells and Heat criticals). These creatures are unaffected by such criticals.</p>
<h3><a name="SL_8.8.5">8.8.5 </a>Spell Attacks Against Items</h3>
<p>Certain spells can attack items or non-living substances (e.g., the <em>Unmetal</em> spell on the Sorcerer Base List destroys metal). If such a spell is cast against an item, a BAR is made by the caster (use the most appropriate column) and a RR is made by the Gamemaster (or player) for the item.</p>
<ul>
<li> If the item is being carried by a living being (i.e., in his “Essence Aura”), its target level is equal to the being’s level.</li>
<li> If the item is magic, its target level is 5 levels per RM +5 bonus (see the Stat Bonus Chart, <a href="#SL_8.2">Section 8.2</a>) or 5 levels per +1 for a spell adder or 5 levels per x1 for a power point multiplier.</li>
<li> If the item is both on a living being and magic, it uses the higher of the two target levels (i.e., do not combine the two potential target levels).</li>
<li> If none of these cases occur, use a target level of one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some materials are highly resistant and would have a higher level as a base for their resistance roll (this should be determined by the GM). Magic items without specific quantitative bonuses (e.g., a ring of invisibility) would also require that the GM assign a level based on its magic abilities.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Unless otherwise specified, a spell which affects a target may also affect objects that he is carrying. An exception may be made for certain unusual items. When computing the effects of an Elemental Attack Spell, always make a distinction between the target and the items he bears; simply follow the appropriate results on the tables.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SL_8.8.6">8.8.6 </a>Critical Strike Results</h3>
<p>Most of the critical strike results are self-explanatory. However, certain results may have to be modified due to circumstances.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A target behind a low stone wall is hit by an Ice Bolt and receives a critical calling for damage to his ankle. Instead the GM should rule that he is hit in the wrist. Note that he already receives a defensive bonus for being behind the stone wall and was hit in spite of it. Similarly, if a critical strike calling for an unspecified limb to be broken is rolled, the limb affected should be determined randomly.
</blockquote>
<h4>OVERALL GUIDELINES</h4>
<ul>
<li> All damage (including concussion hits), unless otherwise noted, is only applicable to the target (or targets).</li>
<li> Often bleeding, bruises, burns, frostbite, etc. indicated on the critical strike tables are reflected in the form of additional concussion hits. This is meant to show the gradual weakening brought about by shock, bleeding, and pain.</li>
<li> Next roll can refer to a missile attack, maneuver, or spell attack, as well as to a melee attack.</li>
<li> If a target takes a critical result that lasts for a certain number of rounds and he has not yet performed his action for the current round, the current round counts as one of the rounds affected by the result. Otherwise, the effects begin the round after the critical is received.</li>
<li> If an item is indicated as being destroyed by a critical result, it is automatically destroyed unless it is made of an extraordinary material (e.g., Mithril) or it is incredibly magical (e.g., an Artifact). In this case, if the GM allows it, the item may make a RR as described in <a href="#SL_8.8.3">Section 8.8.3</a> to avoid destruction.</li>
</ul>
<h4>CRITICAL &amp; FAILURE RESULTS</h4>
<p>All of the tables in this section have two different types of information: descriptions and mechanics.</p>
<ul>
<li> The description information will describe the critical hit (usually including a body location). The GM should feel free to alter the description to more appropriately fit the type of attack.</li>
<li> The mechanics information is the game effects of the critical hit. The GM should rarely alter these results. The presentation of this information will always follow this format:
<blockquote>+ßH–ß∑–ß∏–ß∫ –ß(-α)–ß(+α)</blockquote>
where α and ß are numbers. In general:
<blockquote>
H = hits<br />
∑= rounds of stun<br />
∏= rounds of no parry<br />
π = rounds of must parry <br />
∫ = hits per round<br />
(-α) = penalty<br />
(+α) = bonus<br />
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, the second and third items are combined (reading as ∑∏). Also, sometimes the third item is replaced with ß(π -α) (there can never be both a ∏ and a π entry). Below is a more detailed explanation of the entries.</p>
<ul>
<li> +ßH — This indicates that the target of the attack takes an additional ß hits of damage.</li>
<li> ß∑— This indicates that the target of the attack is stunned for ß rounds. While stunned, the target may only parry with half of his normal ability; the only other allowed actions are maneuvering (modified by at least -50). When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li> ß∏:Thisindicatesthatthetargetoftheattackcannotparryfor ß rounds. The only allowable actions are maneuvering (modified by at least -75). This result is often accompanied by a ∑ result (see above). When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li> ß(π -α): This indicates that the target of the attack must parry for his next ß actions with a penalty of α. When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1. When α is not specified, it is assumed to be zero.</li>
<li> ß∫ : This indicates that the target of the attack will loose ß hits every round until the wound is healed. “Bleeding” represents not only actual blood loss, but also represents ongoing pain. When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li> ß(-α): This indicates the target of the attack suffers a penalty of α for ß rounds. When ß is not specified, the penalty is assumed to last until the wound is healed.</li>
<li> ß(+α): This indicates that the attacker gains a bonus of α for ß rounds. When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="SL_9">9.0 </a>Other Spell Lists</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This section contains three sets of spells lists for three professions that can be found in previous editions of Rolemaster. Though these professions are no longer included in the Rolemaster Standard Rules, they will be covered in detail in upcoming Rolemaster products (e.g., Essence Companion, Channeling Companion, Mentalism Companion, etc.). These lists are included for completeness (to be compatible with previously published Rolemaster support material).</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> The Alchemist profession has been reintroduced to <strong><em>RMSS</em></strong> in <strong><em>Treasure Companion</em></strong> (and all of the Alchemist base lists have been revised). The Astrologer and the Seer will likewise be reintroduced in a future companion. The lists presented here may be used if other companions are not available.
</blockquote>
<h2>How to Use These Lists</h2>
<p>It is strongly recommended that player characters not be allowed to develop these lists. These lists are intended for use by non-player characters (if they are used at all).<br />
If these lists are used, treat them as normal base lists (belonging to a particular profession; all outside that profession must spend extra development points to learn the lists). They are organized and presented just like all of the other lists in this book. All of the standard abbreviations and codes will be used with these lists.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If you are not using <strong><em>Rolemaster (RM)</em></strong>, you should examine all of the Appendices for notes on how to use these tables effectively.
