<h1><a name="Part_I">Part I</a> CONCEPTS AND PREMISES</h1>
<blockquote><p>Grog, holding a large club-like bone, looked to the sky in awe. A mysterious object had begun to block out the sun's light, covering it and all the land in a growing darkness. The unplanned attack they had decided to make on the neighboring clan was receiving help from an unexpected and obviously very powerful being. A crooked smile spread across his dirty face as he grunted to the others that they would wait until the darkness was at it's deepest, then they would attack in the confusion of the other clan. Tonight they would celebrate around the campfire the coming of their newfound benefactor.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a name="CC_1.0">1.0</a> INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>As its name implies, <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> is a process of receiving power from other beings into one's self, then channeling that power to "cast spells." <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic is spiritual and religious in nature. A user of the <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> realm does not get his power points and spells in the same way as an <span id="essence">Essence</span> user. An <span id="essence">Essence</span> user pulls energy directly from the <span id="essence">Essence</span> around him and molds it into spells. A Channeler is, in effect, petitioning his deity for the power to cast <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spells and for the spells themselves. This does not often require active cooperation of the deity, especially when the <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> user is using relatively weak or subtle spells. More powerful and significant spells (death speIls, or the revival of the dead) may require the active cooperation of the deity.</p>
<p>The Channeler derives his power from another being, and is in its debt. If not for his deity, the Channeler would have no power himself. This is how a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user should view his power and ability.</p>
<p>The <em>Channeling Companion</em>'s main focus will be on <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> characters. The purpose of the book is two-fold. The first purpose is to provide additional flavor and uniqueness to <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell users by allowing Gamemasters to tailor the professions of a given deity's religion to reflect the nature of the deity itself.</p>
<p>The second purpose is to provide a series ofrules that relate to <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic that make the realm unique. For example, <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> is the only realm that requires the caster to behave in a very specific way, according to the dictates of another being. Sections covering divine status have been included to make sure that the character is acting in line with the wishes of the being that provides the Channeler with his power. Channelers are watched by their respective deities, sometimes watched very closely, and will fall under rules that will measure their conduct. If they behave and serve their deity well, it will become worthwhile forreasons other than just role playing their character correctly.</p>
<p>Divine intervention is the next major subject that will be covered. Within, you will find some rules to use as guidelines for when a character or party gets themselves into such a deep hole that no mortal help is going to get them out. You will also discover how a character's situation, actions, attitude, and intent will affect that plea for help.</p>
<p>There are four new professions included. There are two hybrid spell users (one for each other realm) and one semi-spell user. Rules for creating Priests of different religions are also introduced. To support the concept that all <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priests</a> should not look alike, a large set of Priest base lists has been included. They are usable by <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> characters to make their <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> unique to the deity they serve.</p>
<p>Also included, are 12 new <a href="../en.lproj/trainingpackages.html">training packages</a>, a discussion of Fate Points, a treatise on the spirit world, and new <a href="../en.lproj/talents.html">talents</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html">flaws</a> especially for <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> characters.</p>
<p>Also, two new Holy Critical Strike Tables are included. They will have many uses within the realm of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic, including corruption, holy spells, and criticals against specific enemies.</p>
<p>One last word of warning before you jump in. The <em>Channeling Companion</em> is written with the "good" <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> character in mind. There are a few examples of evil (<a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Necromancer">Necromancers</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Witch">Witches</a>, etc.), but the evil or neutral view of topics presented herein are not always discussed specifically. You may have need to use this material for an 'evil' religion, and for the evil Channelers in it. In addition, in most worlds there are not only good and evil, but many shades of gray that will need to be addressed as well. Just change what you read to reflect any outlook, whether neutral, evil, or other. Holy could be read as unholy. Creatures "of darkness" would become creatures "of light," etc.</p>
<h4><a name="CC_1.0.0.1">1.0.0.1</a> THE ORIGINS OF CHANNELING MAGIC</h4>
<p>Where the deities came from no one really knows. The stories of how they came to be are widely varied. They may have been born in the fiery furnace of creation. Perhaps they were mortals that gained great magical knowledge and achieved their position on their own. Some of them may be embodiments of the forces of nature. Maybe they were created by the first worshipers of the world by the unknowing mental power and worship of people's beliefs. They could simply be extraordinarily intelligent beings for their time or maybe they are of a different world. Depending on what world, religion, or even person you ask there will be a different explanation. It seems that the deities have always existed. It seems that they were there hefore me races covered the world and will probably always be here.</p>
<p>Deities in many worlds are often grouped into pantheons (groups of deities with similar beliefs and purposes) or sometimes they all have independent goals. It is the GM's job to decide how many and what deities there are in the world, and what their roles are. When a GM has a diverse and interesting group of deities present and working in his world, it adds a great flavor to the campaign.</p>
<p>The most common definition of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic follows: At some point in the history of the world, a relationship arose between mortals and deities. This relationship is called worship. It is the main means by which deities gain their power. The Channeler, as he worships, actually gives part of his <span id="essence">Essence</span> to the deity through daily prayer, sacrifice, and other forms of worship. The more worshipers sacrifice, and other forms of worship. The more worshipers that a deity has, the more powerful he is.</p><p>The deities can be thought of as incredibly powerful beings, independently powerful and needing no external s.ource for their spells and abilities. A deity has the natural ability to gather this collective <span id="essence">Essence</span> from his worshipers and direct that power outward to affect the physical worId. He is also able to channel this power out to his followers in the form of spells. In rare instances, he will use his power to directly intervene in the affairs of one of his worshipers.</p>
<p>This relationship grew down through the years and eventually developed into the realm of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>. Today, there are highly structured churches where anyone can go, and become a follower of a deity. The followers are offered protection, instruction, and social cohesion with other followers of the faith. If properly invested, a follower can become a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user, entering into the above relationship with a deity.</p>
<p>The relationship between worshiper and deity has grown as the years have gone by. The Channeler must adhere to the principles and practices of the deity. They also must spread the word of the deity's power, gain new worshipers, watch over and protect the current ones, and perform special missions as the deity directs. The deity is expected to give a portion of his power to his invested followers and guide the church through its leaders. It becomes a cyclical process, more followers provide more power for the deity, which in turn grants more power to his followers, etc.</p>

<h1><a name="CC_2.0">2.0</a> SOURCES OF MORTAL POWER</h1>
<blockquote><p>Phadan Mac Lir stood in the center of his grove, drawing power from the plants and animals of the forest. As he pulled the power into himselfand channeled it into a viable force the Druid's enemy entered the clearing. Black clouds began to roil above and thunder rolled across the skies as the dark drake came fully into view. Suddenly Phadan threw his hands forward,jingers outstretched towards the drake and a trio oflightning bolts burstfrom the clouds and struck the creature in unison...</p></blockquote>
<p>The source of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> power for characters is always some form of higher power. In most cases, this is a deity, but other sources can be used by a character to gain his power. There are three main sources of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> power: Divine Power, Demonic Power, and Natural Sources. Other sources of power will be discussed as well. Without one of these sources of power, a Channeler is without any way to cast spells.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/2.1/DIVINE POWER" -->
<h2><a name="CC_2.1">2.1</a> DIVINE POWER</h2>
<p>Most of the time, characters will be receiving their power from a deity of a particular Sphere of Influence (see <a href="#CC_2.4">Section 2.4</a>). This is what is called divine power. The character is one of the worshipers of a particular deity who channels them power and the ability to cast their spells. Many of these spells will reflect the nature of the deity, while others will be generic spells that are often sent to worshipers of any deity. Most <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> characters described in the <em>RMSS</em> will draw power this way from adivine being.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/2.2/DEMONIC POWER" -->
<h2><a name="CC_2.2">2.2</a> DEMONIC POWER</h2>
<p>Deals are often struck with Demons or other supernatural forces to gain or obtain power. This can range anywhere from promising monetary or sacrificial offerings to serving the entity and doing its bidding. The problem with this source of power is that the Demon may grow to see this person as expendable, and might fail them or betray them when it is convenient to do so. There are also Demons who hold and maintain a large group of worshipers in the same manner as a deity.</p>
<p>This kind of power can range to other sorts of supernatural beings besides Demons; it could include elemental servants or any other powerful being from another plane. Rarely will a player character draw power from a Demonic source (but perhaps a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> or a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Summoner">Summoner</a> might). Most ofthe time, those that utilize Demonic power are evil.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/2.3/NATURAL SOURCES" -->
<h2><a name="CC_2.3">2.3</a> NATURAL SOURCES</h2>
<p>This is the area of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Animist">Animist</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Druid">Druid</a>, and shaman-type characters. This area is very dependent on the world view of the Gamemaster. Depending on how he sees it, the Channeler may draw power from, and worship, a nature deity or spirit in the same way as a divine power. The GM may also rule that the Channeler may actually be drawing power from the environment itself (plant life, animal life, spirits, etc.). In this case, the Channeler is said to be drawing power from a Sphere of Influence, in a similar way that a deity does (see <a href="#CC_3.1">Section 3.1</a>).</p><p>Treat this type of Channeler as any other for the purposes of casting spells, but there is one drawback. There is obviously no real being to intervene and help the Channeler if he should ever ask for help. This type of Channeler may have a bit more flexibility with his behavior, but suffers a severe penalty when calling for Divine Intervention.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/2.4/SPHERES OF INFLUENCE" -->
<h2><a name="CC_2.4">2.4</a> SPHERES OF INFLUENCE</h2>
<p>There are a few last ways in which a Channeler can gain power. The first is if a Channeler worships a general idea or theme such as "good" or "love." The Channeler is saidto be drawing power directly from a Sphere of Influence, in a similar way as that of a deity. Treat this type of Channeler as any other for the purposes of casting spells. However, not only is there no real being to intervene and help the Channeler, but if the idea that he worships ever disappears from his world, or grows weak, his power will vanish with it. For example, if a world is becoming increasingly cold hearted, and love begins to disappear, then a Channeler that worships the Sphere of Influence of love will suffer from a lack of power.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/2.5/WORSHIPERS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_2.5">2.5</a> WORSHIPERS</h2>
<p>The last <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> source of power for mortals is the same source that would allow someone to gain power and grow to become a deity themselves. If the Gamemaster subscribes to the theory that deities were mortals that have ascended to their position, a being's power could be in the growing and learning phase, somewhere between mortal and deity. Such a being could have a mass of worshipers supporting him, slowly learning to use that power to his advantage while still a mortal. This source should never be utilized by any characters, but could be in use by a very powerful creature, being, or person.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ares, the God of War, viewed the battle that raged below, in exhilaration. Such an immense conflict could only bring him more power. Nevermind who won, that was irrelevant although worthy of some attention. After all, great warriors would make great followers. The Crusaders each would swallow up dozens ofthe undead army's troops over course of the battle. But in the end, sheer numbers could win the day. It would be interesting to see which would prove the greater advantage...</p></blockquote>
<p>The sources of power for deities are Spheres of Influence and worshipers. Spheres of Influence are an idea that a deity represents from which he receives power. Worshipers are external beings whose collective <span id="essence">Essence</span> is given to a deity through worship.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/3.1/SPHERES OF INFLUENCE" -->
<h2><a name="CC_3.1">3.1</a> SPHERES OF INFLUENCE</h2>
<p>Whether a deity, a Demon, or something else, a higher power will usually have a Sphere ofInfluence. A Sphere of Influence is, in its simplest form, a theme, idea, or subject. Some good examples would be Magic, Nature, Fortune, Travel, Life, Death, Fire, Luck, Fear, War, Wind, Love, Peace, or a host of other themes. Deities can gain power from these Spheres of Influence. The act of war could create and "channel" power to the deity of War just as all the wilderness (and its inhabitants) covering much of the world could provide the deity of Nature with a large power base.</p>
<p>This can create countless deities and pantheons in a world without the prerequisite of having followers or worshipers. The drawback is that deities without worshipers would tend to be weaker or less powerful, as they would not have the ability to bring about direct change into a world without doing it themselves. A deity of Nature, ifhe had no followers, would have to rely on the devices of his plants, animals, and other natural elements.</p>
<p>A Sphere if Influence will not always reflect the nature of the deity. A deity of Death may not necessarily be evil; all souls must find their ultimate resting place in death, and that deity might only be there to help in that journey. Likewise, a deity of Fortune may not necessarily be good or evil; that deity may seek to keep everyone from getting everything they want, and therefore only doles out bits and scraps of good fortune here and there with potentially just as much, if not more, misfortune along the way.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/3.2/WORSHIPERS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_3.2">3.2</a> WORSHIPERS</h2>
<p>Worshipers are a much more powerful and direct way of receiving power. Most deities have a large following of humanoid worshipers who, when added together in large numbers, give the deity an enormous amount of power.</p>
<p>What a deity's worshipers receive in return for worship (in addition to spells) can vary greatly from deity to deity. For example, a deity of Sustenance may ensure that farms and fields are kept well watered and keep insects from eating the crops. A deity of Life may allow his worshipers to live just a bit longer. The benefit of having direct worshipers, as opposed to only a Sphere of Influence, is that worshipers can bring about immediate change in the world, by starting wars, retrieving lost objects, and even converting more followers so the deity may gain a larger power base.</p>
<p>The one drawback to receiving power from worshipers is that they are targets for a plague or a rival religion's crusade against them. They can also be converted to another faith.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/3.3/EXAMPLES" -->
<h2><a name="CC_3.3">3.3</a> EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>Amalia, the deity of Life gains her power from both her Sphere of Influence and her followers. Her Sphere of Influence (Life) gives her power as her worshipers give of their lives to further her goals and save the lives of others. Amalia's followers give her power not only in the form of worship and prayer, but also in the form of sacrifices and actions that protect life. Sacrifices take form in time, money, or great deeds. All this power is channeled to Amalia, who gives most of it back to her worshipers in the form of spells to heal, combat Undead, and perform lifegiving rituals. These followers then use that power to further protect life, thereby serving their deity and securing their own source of power.</p>
<p>Maetaran, the deity of Luck, Fate, and Fortune, gains his power as the fate of the world is played out. His is a large sphere, and as such it gi ves him immense power to rule over the fate ofothers. His followers worship and serve him, and provide him with further power. Maetaran gives this power back to his followers and also uses this power to control the destiny of certain people that he sees as instrumental to the fate of the world, whether they are good or evil, and whether they worship him or not.</p>
<p>Brakkas, the deity of Combat, gains great power from the wars of the world. His Sphere of Influence gives him power whenever there is war. His followers give him power as they bravely charge into combat, the highest form of worship to Brakkas. He gives this power back to his followers in the form of spells and guidance during battles. His followers use this power to battle the enemies of their deity.</p>

He made his way to the High Priest, an older man with a lifetime of experience and wisdom. Zemindar recounted his adventurers of the past month, pointing out where he could have done better. The High Priest nodded, and gave council to the young priest. Then they both made their way to the High Priest's chambers.

<p>Every character has a religion, even if that religion is believing in nothing and no one. The broadest definition of a religion is how each person deals with issues of morality, the possible existence of divine beings, and phenomena that cannot be normally explained. Your religion is the collection of your beliefs.</p>
<p>Most deities will have a formal religion set up to support their worshipers. A formal religion is one which has set rituals in their meeting and collectively worship a deity. Each of these religions will probably look different from each other. The following section will explain a few terms usually associated with religions (and how these terms will be used in this book), and then provide a set of guidelines for creating a religion. A complete example of a religion will also be provided. Finally, the effects of a religion on a character will be explored.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/4.1/FOLLOWERS AND MINIONS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_4.1">4.1</a> FOLLOWERS AND MINIONS</h2>
<p>Followers is a broad term for all the people who believe in a particular deity. This term covers everything from those in church for the first time to the deity's most powerful champions and servitors. Followers do not necessarily have to attend services or go to meetings regularly, but they do look to the deity for inspiration, help, and protection, even if infrequently. Any intelligent being can be a potential follower, and he does not have to be a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user or have <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> as his realm. Non spell users and spell users of another realm may be followers. Followers also do not have to be particularly dedicated or have a great amount of faith.</p>
<p>As most followers do not formally worship, they gain no external benefits from beingjust a follower. The deity may gain a bit ofpower from their worship, but they have not yet entered the formal relationship of worship, and so most followers gain nothing from the deity.</p>
<p>Minions are the servile followers ofan evil cult, religion, or other movement. A minion is also not necessarily a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user. An evil deity may, along with his priests, have a mass of brainwashed minions that will obey his every command, sometimes against their natural instincts. Minions also include any creatures that a religion has summoned or called to serve it. Any creature that is a servant to the cause of evil could be considered a minion, but the term is usually reserved for the low level followers.</p>

<h2><a name="CC_4.2">4.2</a> WORSHIPPERS</h2>
<p>Worshipers are invested followers. They almost always have <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> as at least one of their realms (though there are rare exceptions). This group normally includes <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell users, <span id="none">Arms</span> users with <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> as their realm, and <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> spell users. Worshipers actively participate in services regularly to venerate their deity. Worshipers must work for and obey their deity to keep their power. If they do not follow the tenants of their religion, they will lose any spell casting abilities that rely on their <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> source of power.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/4.3/CHANCELLORS AND PRIESTS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_4.3">4.3</a> CHANCELLORS AND PRIESTS</h2>
<p>Chancellors comprise the administration of a religious organization. A chancellor is often one of the leaders or figureheads of a religion, and he has usually dedicated his life to service within the church. A chancellor is usually a mid- to high-level <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user. The abilities of a chancellor can vary greatly depending on his status before being appointed, but he will always have a very deep understanding of the organization's beliefs and practices.</p>
<p>Priests are the elite ofa religion's worshippers. They are the adventurers, protectors, and miracle workers in direct service to their respective deity. They are given powers of a nature that directly correspond to the powers of the deity and his Sphere of Influence. Adventuring player characters will often be priests to their deities.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/4.4/CHAMPIONS AND SAINTS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_4.4">4.4</a> CHAMPIONS AND SAINTS</h2>
<p>Champions are those figures of a religion that have done something extraordinary for their deity, and are well-known for it. Champions can be anyone from <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladins</a> to <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Healer">Healers</a> to <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighters</a>, and do not necessarily have to be <span id="chaneling">Channeling</span> spell users. They are usually very well known within a faith, and often by many people outside the religion. A champion is famous and respected usually for something he has done: enemies he has defeated, a grand quest he has accomplished, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a saint is famous for things that he has written. Saints are scholars and philosophers within a religion that have heavily influenced the beliefs of the worshipers. While sometimes revealing new teachings, saints often only shed new light on existing religious texts. Saints are often only given recognition posthumously, when the genius oftheir work is explored by other worshippers.</p>
<p>Champions and saints can be people who have represented an idea or theme in such a manner that they have become a symbol of that ideal or theme. They may be symbols of values and beliefs that people look to for help, receive inspiration from, or even fear, thereby giving their deity support through his Sphere of Influence. In addition to the above reasons, the titles of champion and saint are sometimes conferred on any person who has performed some great miracle for the faith.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/4.5/CREATIONS AND SERVITORS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_4.5">4.5</a> CREATIONS AND SERVITORS</h2>
<p>These two types ofcreatures representthe "otherworldly" side ofa religion, and hence, they are rarely seen. Creations are beings that have been directly created by the deity. An example of a creation might be a Unicorn. Unicorns may have been created by the deity of the forest to protect its inhabitants. A creation can be almost anything, as most deities have great power. They can be anything from a ghost to a unicorn to an artificial construct such as a statue.</p>
<p>Servitors are the powerful, extra-planar servants of a deity. Servitors manifest themselves as Angels, Demons, Spirits, or other types of beings. A servitor is usually immortal, and might even be a minor deity in his own right. In some cases, a servitor may once have been a mortal who was promoted to or awarded with the honor of becoming a servant of his deity. While any powerful deity is still infinitely more powerful than a servitor, the latter is extremely powerful when compared to mortals.</p>
<p>A servitor's powers and abilities will vary greatly depending on their purpose, and the corresponding deity's needs and wants. Some of them will be sent to directly affect the mortal world, while others are prevented from interfering directly in the affairs of mortals. The Angels mentioned in the short story at the beginning of this book are also examples of servitors. See <a href="5540.html">Creatures and Monsters</a> for examples of creatures that would make suitable servitors.</p>

<h2><a name="CC_4.6">4.6</a> AVATARS</h2>
<p>An avatar is perhaps the most powerful entity next to the deity itself. An avatar is one of two things. It is either a physical representation of adeity itself, or it is a mortal who has been temporarily invested with the power of a deity. For a deity to assume or create an avatar, there must be some extraordinary reason such as a major war, a possible loss of thousands of followers, or other such catastrophic event. The appearance of an avatar is one of the most important events that can happen to a religion. Such an event would surely be the origins of a holy day or yearly celebration such as a feast or other festival.</p>
<p>The avatar of a deity will have many of the powers and abilities that the deity possesses, as it has a direct channel to its deity. However, an avatar is not a deity. Though the manifestation is mortal, and capable of taking physical damage and dying, it will be vastly more powerful than even the strongest creation or servitor.</p>
<p>It may be possible to destroy the avatar's body, but there is never any real threat to the deity's true life force. Such an occurrence may lead the offending party to believe they have defeated a deity when in reality, all they have done is incited its wrath.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/4.7/RELIGIOUS ORDERS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_4.7">4.7</a> RELIGIOUS ORDERS</h2>
<p>Most deities will have a formal religious order that serves many purposes. Religious orders provide Channelers with rules and regulations. A Gamemaster should design each of the religions of his world, keeping the Sphere of Influence of each deity in mind. The Sphere of Influence and the personality of a deity will influence what constitutes worshiping the deity, what types of spells it will give to its followers, and what the religion will be like in general.</p>
<p>A few areas that will need to be covered by a Gamemaster creating a religion are the following: How much of a worshiper's wealth is required to be donated to the religion? What is forbidden to the members of the religion? What is the method for punishing those who stray from the faith? How is the religion governed? What special ceremonies, holidays, and clothing does the religion have? What do they use for holy symbols? Is there any special clothing that members wear? What is the relationship between the religion and the state or country where the religion exists? How do outsiders view the religion and its followers? How does the religion view outsiders and other religions? Are there official canonized works of the church? Who are the church's main enemies? What is the history ofthe religion?</p>
<h5><a name="CC_4.7.0.0.1">4.7.0.0.1</a> Example</h5>
<p>Azayan is the deity of Justice. His sphere of influence includes punishment and obeying the law. The religion follows a generally good philosophy, but can be vigilante at times. By nature, the religion has a close relationship with the local governments, with many of its priests serving both within the church and the government. The only problems with the law arise when a guilty man is set free and the church of Azayan ensures that the criminal does not make it out of town alive.</p>
<p>The religiun is very strict. Members are required to pay a tithe (10% of their wealth) to the church, which uses this money to build churches and temples, help the state build prisons, and even to track down murderers and thieves. Those who stray from the faith are given a fair church trial, but will be cast out if the church deems it necessary.</p>
<p>Members ofthe church wear amulets with the symbol of balance on them, symbolizing fairness and justice for all. The church cdebrates on the day the religion was founded, and the days that famous criminals were caught or killed. Outsiders (that obey the law) generally view the religion and its members as a welcome sight.</p>

<h2><a name="CC_4.8">4.8</a> RELIGION AND THE CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>The religion of a character will not only cover how the character will act, it will also give distinction to that character's spells and special abilities. The character's religion will often have an effect on many aspects of a character:</p>
<h5><a name="CC_4.8.0.0.1">4.8.0.0.1</a> Summoning Spells</h5>
<p>In addition to getting their very power from another being, sometimes that help will actually come in the form ofanotherbeing. Many <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell users cast explicit summoning spells to bring creatures to help the caster. Other times, a deity will answer a call for help by sending a creature to help the Channeler.</p>
<p>In all cases, the type of creature that arrives will be related to the character's religion. In the case of good characters, they could be Angels, Fairies, or other creatures of good. Characters of evil might summon Demons, Undead, or any of many evil types of creatures. Other characters might summon Genii, animals, or Elementals. <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priests</a> of wind might summon flying creatures, etc. The GM should generate well ahead of time the various types of creatures that the character might receive help from.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_4.8.0.0.2">4.8.0.0.2</a> Criticals</h5>
<p>A character's religion will also affect the type ofcriticalshe does with his spells. Many spells that now read "gives a holy critical," or "gives a fire critical" could be changed to deliver a type of critical of a type more appropriate to the character's religion. For instance, a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Fire</a> might have the <em>Holy Wrath</em> spell list, yet use Heat criticals with it. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin</a> to a Fire deity might deliver a Heat critical instead of a Holy Critical with his <em>Holy Aura</em> spell, etc.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_4.8.0.0.3">4.8.0.0.3</a> Skills</h5>
<p>A character's religion might also affect how some of his skills are used. For example, the skill <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Power_Perception">Power Perception</a> might detect his religion's or an opposing religion's spells only, or detect whether an item or site is holy. Evil characters might use the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Seduction">Seduction</a> skill differently than a good character. The <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Divination">Divination</a> skill might be used for discerning the past, present, or the future, depending on which one your faith focuses the most on. These are only suggestions, GM's are encouraged to determine ways in which skills can be specialized to each character's religion.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_4.8.0.0.4">4.8.0.0.4</a> Spells</h5>
<p>A character's <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html">spells</a> might also be cast differently, depending on their religion, or require different components. One religion may require a holy symbol to cast its spells, while another may require you to close yuur eyes and pray as each spell is cast. All religions venerate their deity in different ways, and the means and methods of how they cast their spells will vary.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_4.8.0.0.5">4.8.0.0.5</a> Divine Intervention</h5>
<p>Your deity and religion will determine what, if any, help that your deity will send to you. It may be that you worship a deity that wants its followers to fend for themselves, and he will take care of them in the afterlife. You might also have a deity that demands more of you by way of sacrifice and rules, but will help you more often.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_4.8.0.0.6">4.8.0.0.6</a> Talents and Flaws</h5>
<p>Your religion might not determine all of your <a href="../en.lproj/talents.html">talents</a>, but it might determine some special <a href="../en.lproj/talents.html">talents</a> that others would not have. The character also may well have found a religion that matches his <a href="../en.lproj/talents.html">talents</a> and joined it. GMs are encouraged to tailor the <a href="../en.lproj/talents.html">talents</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html">flaws</a> to the character's religion.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dirnen left the temple, and went straight to the tavern. How dare they accuse him oftaking matters into his own hands? Decisions made in the heat of battle cannot be judged by those who were not there. Hehadhisreasonsforkillingwhohedid, andstillthe church questioned him.

That was when he entered. The Magician that had killed Dirnen's bestfriend a year ago. Dirnen rose from his seat and calledforth the power of his deity to prepare for the battle. Nothing. No power came forth. Cursing his deity, Dirnen attacked his enemy. Alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>All Channelers receive their power to cast spells from a eitheradeity or some other, external source. Unlike the natural or learned talents of <span id="essence">Essence</span> and <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>, <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic is a given ability. Channelers are given their power from another being and are asked to do certain things to keep that power. There are many duties that deities will require of their followers, and these duties will differ from religion to religion. How well a follower is living up to the requirements ofhis religion is called Divine Status. The Gamemaster should let the player know well ahead of time what will be required of his Channeler to maintain good divine status.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_6.0.0.0.1">6.0.0.0.1</a> Divine Status</h5>
<p>Divine Status is a measure of how well a character is looked upon in the eyes of his deity. For a good deity, it might be a composite measure of how well the character treats other people, how well they live up to their responsibilities, and how well they pay homage to their deity. Of course, for a deity of chaos, it might be a measure of how much chaos and confusion that the character has caused. It is necessarily different for every distinct religion. Divine Status is more than just symbolic. It can affect how well the character casts the spells that he receives from his deity. It Lan also have a great effect on how well petitions for Divine Intervention are received.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/6.1/STATUS LEVEL" -->
<h2><a name="CC_6.1">6.1</a> STATUS LEVEL</h2>
<p>Divine Status is measured on a scale. Characters will almost always start with a Divine Status level 5. There may be exceptional circumstances that warrant otherwise. Perhaps a player may want to playa character that has lost his faith and is trying to get it back. This character may start out with a lower status. The status levels are explained below.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/6.2/GRACE" -->
<h2><a name="CC_6.2">6.2</a> GRACE</h2>
<p>Grace points are a concrete method of keeping track of how loyal a character is to his deity's rules and laws. When a character does something that is important which is in line with his religion the GM should award him with grace points. The act must be important. It cannot be something that the character is supposed to do anyway, like to go church. There must be some significant choice involved in the matter, where the character chose to follow his deity.</p>
<p>Grace points are removed when a sin toward the religion is committed. If the character has no grace points, corruption points will be awarded instead. Ifthe character only commits a small sin, then he should not incur a major penalty.</p>
<p>Grace points are not linked with experience points, they are linked with a character's good actions. Grace points can be given for small acts, like helping those people around the character. They are also given for acting appropriately in agiven situation. The GM should give out many more grace points for any heroic or highly altruistic actions of the character.</p><!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/6.3/CORRUPTION" -->
<h2><a name="CC_6.3">6.3</a> CORRUPTION</h2>
<p>Members of different religions are always trying to sway each other to their beliefs. In addition, "great evil forces" sometimes actively seek to corrupt spell users. The following rules on corruption points are different than those in <a href="5500A.html#RMSR_A-9.3">Section A-9.3</a> of the <em>RMSR</em> dealing with a "great evil force" that corrupts <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell users. However, they do not prevent a Gamemaster from using both sets of rules together (using these rules for <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell users, and the <em>RMSR</em> for <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell users). The way corruption works with <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic, and how corruption points are acquired, are different from the <span id="essence">Essence</span> corruption rules. The following section will explain.</p>
<p>First, the Gamemaster may feel that even if there is a "great evil force" that is corrupting magic in his world, that a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> character may still cast his spells normally. <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic does not work the same way as <span id="essence">Essence</span> magic. A channel opens between the character and his deity, allowing him to cast the spell. No other power need be able to sense that a spell was just cast. The "great evil force" would not be able to interfere at all.</p>
<p>Second, corruption points should not only be given for spell failures, but also spell success as well. It does not really matter if the <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell was cast successfully or not. The deity knows what the Channeler was attempting. What matters to the caster's deity is ifthe spell was cast for "pure" goals (i.e., directly working against or fighting evil, protecting the weak and helpless, healing the sick and Injured, etc.). The GM should apply a number ofcorruption points to a Channeler based on how evil an act is, and perhaps also on how high level of a spell was used. The difference is that a "great evil force" does not know everything, but a deity may. It does not matter if a spell fails or succeeds, the corruption points still apply.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_6.3.0.0.1">9.3.0.0.1</a> Hybrid Spell Users</h5>
<p>These corruption point rules can combine to make life difficult for a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> hybrid spell user, such as a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> or a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Summoner">Summoner</a>, in a world with a "great evil force" that corrupts the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. If the GM wishes, he could just combine the character's <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> corruption points together with his <span id="essence">Essence</span> corruption points for purposes of the Divine Status table above, and for the rules in the <em>RMSR</em>. The character could then corrupt himself, by committing acts of evil against its religion, and at the same time be corrupted by way of spell failures, by the "great evil force" through the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. No one ever said that being a hybrid was easy.</p>
<p>The penalties for casting his spells and method for acquiring corruption points from his two realms are different. His purely <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> lists would follow the rules in this section, his purely <span id="essence">Essence</span> lists would follow those in the <em>RMSS</em>. Casting spells from his hybrid base lists, however, would leave him susceptible to both types of corruption. In addition, all spell casting penalties from corruption apply to their base lists. The only good news is that hybrids may still use <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html">Open and Closed spells</a> from their non-Channeling realm without any penalties, even if their Divine Status level drops.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_6.3.0.0.2">6.3.0.0.2</a> Arcane Spell Users</h5>
<p><span id="arcane">Arcane</span> spell users are treated a bit differently than those with <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> as a realm. Even though <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> spell users utilize a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> source of power for their spells, they can still cast their spells without the aid of a deity. If a deity ever withdraws his support from a character of the <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> realm, the following will happen.</p>
<p>First, apply only half of the spell casting penalties to the <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> spells cast by the <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> spell users if they lose Divine Status, as they try and pull the power from the <span id="essence">Essence</span> and their own mind. Second, the <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> spell user will gain double the number of all <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> (and other) corruption points than a normal <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user would gain. <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> magic is ancient, powerful, and addictive. Use all other rules found in the <a href="5600.html#AC_9.4"><em>Arcane Companion</em> Section 9.4</a> as written.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_6.3.0.0.3">6.3.0.0.3</a> Corruption Points</h5>
<p>Corruption points represent a moving away from a character's faith and a separation from the Channeler's deity. When a Channeler gains corruption points, they begin to change, and to fall away from the teachings and beliefs of their faith. Good characters might grow evil and rebellious. For someone who is evil, they might start to lose the belief that the their ways of evil are right. They could be drawn a step toward good or some other belief system. They might also begin to believe that the powers that they have been given are inadequate. For example, a Healer with corruption points will begin to feel that healing is worthless and that goals can be accomplished only through harming. A Summoner with corruption points would feel that he needs no additional help to solve his problems and he will try to do everything himself. Corruption often turns an individual into the opposite of what he currently is.</p>
<p>The end result is that Channelers with a lot of corruption points face two problems. First, their deity will take away their spell casting ability in direct proportion to their corruption points, as they are no longer worshiping the deity as well as they should. Second, such a Channeler becomes more like his enemies with each corruption point he gains.</p>
<p>In the <em>RMSR</em>, 100 corruption points indicates that someone is a totally evil person. As shown above, 50 points gets you kicked out of your religion forever. A total of 100 Channeling corruption points would indicate that you have become corrupted to the opposite of what you once were.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_6.3.0.0.4">6.3.0.0.4</a> Gaining and Losing Divine Status</h5>
<p>Progress upward through the levels of Divine Status is different than progress down. Progress upward through the levels takes a much longer time. The character must work hard to show his deity that he is unwavering in his faith. The process of moving upward through the levels of Divine Status usually takes many years, and many experience levels. Divine Status levels of 9 and 10 should take most of (if not all of) a characters life to attain, as well as some great and heroic accomplishments.</p>
<p>Moving down the Divine Status levels is different. One grace point is not worth one corruption point, in the same way that one evil act is not worth four good acts. When dealing with sins, it is hard to quantify things into numbers, but the GM should determine a grace or corruption point penalty for each wrong act of a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> character. If the character commits any sin the GM feels should land the character in the Unfaithful level, or below, the character should just go straight there; losing any and all grace points in the process. It is entirely possible, that with one wrong act, the character can go to the Banished level.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/6.4/TEMPTATION" -->
<h2><a name="CC_6.4">6.4</a> TEMPTATION</h2>
<p>GMs are encouraged to put <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> characters in tempting situations that may lead them astray and result in a loss of grace points or a gaining of corruption points. Tempting situations are not always easy choices like saving someone's life verses running after someone who stole a bag of copper pieces from the character. Examples follow.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_6.4.0.0.1">6.4.0.0.1</a> Example</h5>
<p>Validian has been told to donate one of his better items to his church. He might be tempted to give them his +5 robes. He might also chose to give them his + 10 quarterstaff, but he really should give the church his +15 Amulet of Protection that has additional magical properties. Depending on what he gives the church, the following could happen:</p>
<p>Give the robes: +3 corruption points</p>
<p>Give the quarterstaff: +1 corruption point</p>
<p>Give the amulet: +5 grace points</p>
<h5><a name="CC_6.4.0.0.2">6.4.0.0.2</a> Example</h5>
<p>Bonham is chasing an enemy he has been hunting for years. During the chase, he spots a man surrounded by three thieves down a side street. Bonham is unsure what the outcome of that battle would be. The man could be robbed, or perhaps killed if left unaided. Bonham takes a quick moment to decide.</p>
<p>Leave the man and chase his enemy: +6 corruption points</p>
<p>Watch to see that it is a fair fight, then leave: +3 corruption points</p>
<p>Help the man: +8 grace points</p>
<h5><a name="CC_6.4.0.0.3">6.4.0.0.3</a> Example</h5>
<p>Kaja the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Druid">Druid</a> and his enemy both learn at the same time of an item which would be helpful to either of them. He must leave immediately if he is to beat his enemy to the item. Soon after, Kaja learns of a possible forest fire in the area.</p>
<p>Go after the item and ignore the fire: + 10 corruption points</p>
<p>Send others to help with the fire: +4 corruption points</p>
<p>Go to the fire: +4 grace points</p>
<p>These are only examples. Every situation should be different depending on the character and the circumstances that he is in at the time of the temptation. The GM will be the final arbiter of how many grace or corruption points will be awarded, and any new status levels awarded to the character.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/6.5/REDEMPTION" -->
<h2><a name="CC_6.5">6.5</a> REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>After a character has strayed from his religion, it becomes very difficult to work his way back. The Channeler has an uphill battle to fight, as he must not only act in accordance with his religion, but must make up for his past transgressions at the same time.</p>
<p>Each religion will have different ways of dealing with transgressors. Some religions do not forgive at all, while many faiths will obviously hear the cries of forgiveness from an errant worshiper and let them know how to find their way back. However, if a character has reached the Damned level of Divine Status, he may not be redeemed at all.</p>
<p>Redemption and the removal of corruption points is accomplished by action. It is possible to remove some kinds of corruption points and outside influences with skills and spells. But any action that a character purposely and willfully committed must be redeemed by the atonement and repentance of the sinning character.</p><p>There are two things that a Channeler must do to regain his faith. The first is to perform whatever service his church requires of him as restitution. This could include many hours of service for the church. It could include special missions. Keep in mind that doing things that the character would normally do is not a punishment. The church may also require some sizable monetary payment, hard work, or some great sacrifices from the Channeler to show remorse for his sins.</p>
<p>The second thing that the Channeler must do is to appease his deity. After the character has cleared things up with the church, he may then attempt to regain his spell casting powers in full, and lose his corruption points. The deity will not usually talk to the Channeler in person, so the character must do his best to work his way back into good favor, and wait until his power returns. The time spent in repentance will be in proportion to the amount of corruption points that the character has accumulated. The day he casts a spell without any penalties is his day of his atonement.</p>

<h1><a name="CC_7.0">7.0</a> DIVINE INTERVENTION</h1>
<blockquote><p>Silvak cursed as his final ally fell to the skeletal hands of his attackers. How were they to know that this small cave would produce so many Undead? Though he had great power over these unholy creatures, his friends did not. They had all fallen within the lastfew moments, and if he stayed, soon he would follow. Running was not an option. Silvak was true to his friends, and would stay that way until his death. Never had he asked his deity for anything before, but the lives of all his friends were at stake. How could he show his deity that he needed his help? He reached for his father's amulet, a precious keep sake of over a decade. He held it aloft with his magical morning star, offering them up to his deity, while the remaining Undead gathered to smother the life from him. "Jensia, my lord, I humbly califor your help in this time of need..."</p></blockquote>
<p>There come many times in the lives of some adventurers when it is certain that death has come to claim them, and they will look to higher powers for help. <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> is a strict realm, with many rules to follow and abide by. The payoff to following all ofthe rules and restrictions may be that once in a very great while, a loyal follower may be able to get some help from the being supplying him with power (beyond normal spells). This kind of extra help is called Divine Intervention.</p>
<p>Each Gamemaster will allow a different amount of Divine Intervention in their game. Divine Intervention should always be used very sparingly. Divine Intervention is rare, but not because the deity lacks the power to help his followers all the time. It happens sparingly for a few reasons. First, when a deity gets involved directly with the mortal world, other deities may interfere in the situation as well, perhaps escalating into a power struggle that neither deity really wants. Second,just as you can spoil a child, you can spoil a Channeler by always giving them what they want. For these and other reasons, Divine Intervention is rare, and usually subtle (although some campaigns will be exceptions to this).</p>
<p>There are three levels of frequency of Divine Intervention: Active, Passive, and Dormant. In the Dormant intervention game, Channelers are given their spells, and are otherwise left alone for the rest of their lives. The deity generally never helps his worshipers out in any special way. <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spells are almost the entire extent of that deity's intervention in the mortal world. In a Passive intervention game, Divine Intervention will be given rarely, and usually only in dreams or symbols, and perhaps a minor display of power once in a great while. In an Active intervention game, the character's deity helps him out once in a while by sending either his servitors to help, or by sending the Channeler special powers. On these worlds, the deities playa greater role in mortal affairs. Even on these worlds, intervention is still rare, and the deity will never show up "in person."</p>
<p>Divine Intervention will definitely occur when the deity stands to lose a great many followers, for if he loses them, his power slips. Gamemasters should use their best judgment as to when Divine Intervention should be allowed to happen.</p>

<h2><a name="CC_7.1">7.1</a> THE PRAYER</h2>
<p>To ask a deity for help, a Channeler must pray and make a Divine Intervention Static Maneuver. This maneuver is usually done by kneeling down, (or whatever action represents venerating your deity), humbly letting the deity know that the situation is beyond your control, and humbly asking for his help. Usually the character must be in some sort of dire need to receive aid from his deity. The character rolls d100 (open-ended high) and adds his <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Channeling">Channeling</a> skill bonus. The roll is modified by the character's Divine Status (see below), any sacrifices he makes (see below), any covenants he offers (see below), and the following modifiers.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/7.2/DIVINE STATUS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_7.2">7.2</a> DIVINE STATUS</h2>
<p>The Gamemaster will further modify the Divine Intervention Static Maneuver according to how a character has been abiding by the precepts ofhis religion. The Gamemaster should look at the character's Divine Status and give the character either a bonus or a penalty according to how they have performed their duties and kept their faith. These bonuses for Divine Status and appropriate conduct can range anywhere between -50 to +50. The exact bonus is up to the GM.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Orrissa, a Priest of Fire, has been a bad girl, accruing 12 corruption points. The GM decides to subtract 2 times her corruption points from her prayerfor aid. A -24 is applied to her Divine Intervention maneuver.</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/7.3/SACRIFICES" -->
<h2><a name="CC_7.3">7.3</a> SACRIFICE</h2>
<p>As an aid in asking for help, a character may wish toincrease the chances that his deity hears his call by sacrificing something of value. Sacrifices are worth more when they are very important to the character. The GM will be the final arbiter on what is truly valuable to the character.</p>
<p>A common sacrifice is a magic item. Sacrifices of important magical items can give a bonus to the Divine Intervention Static Maneuver from +5 to +50, depending on the magical power of the item and its worth to the character. A ring of +5 to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Cooking">Cooking</a> maneuvers will probably not get you quite the same bonus as a +35 Deathsword will. The actual worth of the item is not important; the relative worth of the item to the character making the sacrifice is what is measured. The bottom line is that a deity will hear your call when you sacrifice something to him that is very meaningful to you. It is not that the deity needs the item, it does not. The deity simply wants you to have faith in him and his power.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Elera sacrifices her valuable magic holy symbol, a special giftfrom her husband, to her deity with a pleafor help. The GM chooses to add +15 to her Divine Intervention maneuver.</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/7.4/COVENANTS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_7.4">7.4</a> COVENANTS</h2>
<p>There are times that a Channeler may get stuck fighting forces vastly superior to his; yet he may have no magic items to offer, or he may be a new Priest that has not yet proven himself. What can such a character do then, what options does he have?</p>
<p>He can commit himself. Promising no end to the great deeds that will be done in the name of his deity for years to come. The Channeler can covenant with his deity that he will do something for the deity, if he helps the character. With nothing else to offer, this is all a character has. The GM, of course, will be the arbiter of whether the deity will think that a covenant holds weight. He will also decide how much will be added to the Divine Intervention maneuver based on what he thinks the covenant is worth. Covenants will add between +5 and +20 to the Divine Intervention maneuver.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Anborn promises his deity that he will dedicate the next two years ofhis life to protect and serve at his deity's temple. The GM decides to add +5 to his Divine Intervention maneuver.</blockquote>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/7.5/THE MANEUVER" -->
<h2><a name="CC_7.5">7.5</a> THE MANEUVER</h2>
<p>There are a few rules associated with the Divine Intervention Static Maneuver. First, in combat, the Divine Intervention static maneuver is a 100% action. This maneuver is not modified by the amount of hits taken or the amount of exhaustion points expended. The maneuver is modified only by what is listed in this section, and any power or ability that specifically states that it affects calling on your deity for help.</p>
<p>Second, the Channeler must be in good graces with his deity to receive any help at all. There is no way that a character can receive help by just rolling very high on the dice. Even ifhe makes the maneuver, the OM is the one to determine ifhe receives any help based on his situation and Divine Status. An easy way to measure this is whether the character has a Divine Status of 5 or greater. If he does, it is likely that he has enough favor to call for help. If the character's Divine Status is below 5, there should be some very serious sacrifices or covenants offered to the deity to make up for the low status.</p>
<p>Third, it is possible to modify the Divine Intervention maneuver roll after it has been made, by any of the means mentioned above. Sacrifices and Covenants might be accepted by the deity after the roll, but they will be given only half of their value. In other words, if a character could have sacrificed his Wand of Water Bolts for a +10 to the roll before the maneuver, then it is only worth +5 after the roll. In the case of a promise, twice as much will have to be promised to equal what he would have gotten had he promised it before the roll. This is to represent that a true believer gives and promises with total faith in his deity.</p>
<p>The GM will know how close a character is to success when he makes the Divine Intervention maneuver roll. Based on how close he is, and what he can offer the deity by way of items or promises, the GM will consider having the deity accept a sacrifice or a covenant at that point. The total result of the character's Divine Intervention Static Maneuver is applied to the Divine Intervention Static Maneuver table below.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a character be allowed to try for Divine Intervention only once in a certain time period such as a month or a year. It is also suggested that after help is given, no help be given for a certain space of time, perhaps between one and three years. It can also be set up like a reserve that slowly fills back up after use. If the character calls for help soon after receiving it, even ifthe roll is made, very little help will be given. Or perhaps the more often a call is made, the larger a penalty will be applied to roll (with many years between calls for help resulting in a positive modifier).</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/7.6/ANSWERED PRAYERS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_7.6">7.6</a> ANSWERED PRAYERS</h2>
<p>This area is very character dependent, religion dependent, and profession dependent. The exact nature of the help that a Channeler will receive will take various forms that reflect his deity's Sphere of Influence. The examples that follow are appropriate for a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Druid">Druid</a> type character. What is presented here is only a template to be emulated, using results obtained from the Divine Intervention Maneuver table. The exact help will be different for each type of Channeler, and it will be different for the levels of intervention present in the world that the Channeler lives in.</p>
<p>Most often, a deity will send help very indirectly, by way of servants or blessings to the caster's actions. Rarely will anything come from the deity himself, though his presence might be felt. Divine help should always fit the situation that a Channeler is in. This may often be in a combat situation, but may just as likely be when the Channeler is facing unknown dangers or making crucial decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Divine Help</strong>&mdash;Deity sends direct help to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Druid">Druid</a> in the form of protection spells, added DB, OB, or replenished hits or power points. The deity could also send the Druid intuitions and insights related to his situation, which might be delivered to him by animals or plants, or in a vision.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate Divine Help</strong>&mdash;Deity sends help in the form of the environment. Perhaps nearby rocks animate as Earth Elementals under the control of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Druid">Druid</a>. If in a forest, the trees may animate for the caster. The wind may carry the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Druid">Druid</a> to a safe place, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Major Divine Help</strong>&mdash;Deity sends primary forces to protect the caster from danger. This may take the form of the wind blocking all attacks against the caster, rocks suddenly rolling off nearby hills and into enemies, water from a nearby pond drowning an enemy or forming a wall around the caster, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Divine Help</strong>&mdash;Deity sends some of his personal power to the caster to defeat his enemies. Those present (or nearby) may hear the voice of the deity, as well as be affected by it. The Channeler may take on some aspects of his deity that reflect the deity's Sphere of Influence.</p>
<p>A few further examples follow. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Healer">Healer</a> could receive extra healing powers, or protections. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin</a>'s deity might inspire all of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin</a>'s allies to fight better. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Ranger">Ranger</a>'s deity might guide him out of danger, or send animals to help. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Summoner">Summoner</a>'s deity may send powerful extra-planar entities to help. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> could receive different kinds of help in destroying his enemies. For the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priests</a> of any religion, aid would conform to the standards of their religion.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/7.7/OBLIGATIONS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_7.7">7.7</a> OBLIGATIONS</h2>
<p>After intervention has occurred (and the Channeler has thanked his deity many times), it is not over. The character may be obligated to return the favor to his deity. The deity may ask for a sacrifice, or that the Channeler perform some mission in return. Missions could range from going to an evil temple and smashing it to pieces to recovering stolen gold from a group of thieves and then donating it to the needy.</p>
<p>The deity might even let his worshiper know what will be required of him before he gives the help, and let the worshiper decide whether or not to accept the offer and receive the help. The deity might also just give help, then require service later. It depends on the deity's disposition toward his followers. In the end, the Channeler had better sacrifice the required items and perform the requested missions if he ever wants help again.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Jadan has just received Divine Intervention. Back at his temple, the High Priest tells Jadan that he must spend the next 6 months working for the church.</blockquote>

<p>This section discusses how to create priests for a specific religion (and have them be unique in a given game setting). Note that <a href="#CC_16.0">Section 16.0</a> provides a more detailed system for creating "specialty" priests. It should be noted that the process of creating a "priesthood" should be left to the hands of the Gamemaster (though Gamemasters may allow the players to design their religions' priesthood with some specific guidance).</p>

As such, they will all have the same prime requisites and as such, they will use the development point costs as shown below.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/9.2/SPHERE OF INFLUENCE" -->
<h2><a name="CC_9.2">9.2</a> SPHERE OF INFLUENCE</h2>
<p>After establishing the basic template, you must establish which Sphere of Influence the religion's diety covers. Use the chart on the subsequent page (a more complete listing of spheres can be found starting on page 120) to determine which Sphere ofInfluence is appropriate to the concept for the deity. A given Sphere ofInfluence will determine what specialities the religion will have.</p>
<p>If the Gamemaster deems it appropriate, a given deity may have more than one Sphere of Influence. If this is the case, the Gamemaster should average the Profession Bonuses from the table (rounding up to the nearest +5; making sure that the total bonuses do not exceed +50). In addition, all skill classifications should apply (except where contradictory skill classifications are given; in which case, take the most restrictive of the set).</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong>  If the Gamemaster thinks that it is too generous to give all of the skill classifications for both Spheres, he can take halfofthe skill classifications (round up) from each (though he will have to make some judgement about which half to take).</blockquote>
<p>The Sphere ofInfluence chosen dictates the additions to the template that will complete the Priest profession. This includes Profession Bonus, Skill Classifications, <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html">Spell Lists</a>, and other special notes. Also listed is an alterate prime requisite (if the GM so desires to vary the prime requisites by religion); this prime requisite should replace Memory as a prime requisite.</p>

<h2><a name="CC_9.3">9.3</a> SPELL LISTS</h2>
<p>All of the spell lists that Priests have access to are base lists. Many of the spell lists may be found in <a href="#CC_17.5">Section 17.5</a> of this book. That section gives a plethora of new spell lists that are specifically designed for use by priests. For non-Priests, these spell lists may be developed as any other <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> base lists (Same/Other Realm &bull; Other Base List). The same is true for Priests who want access to lists that are not part of their definition. It should be noted that the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric Base lists</a> are often awarded to Priests as Base lists (as are certain other profession base lists).</p>
<p>GMs should feel free to adjust the lists given to a specific relgion. Those listed in the table on the following pages are meant to act as a guide (and are typically considered balanced). GMs should examine each religion carefully and adjust the spell lists that religion has access to accordingly.</p>

<p>Each training package gives a character one or more of the following benefits/disadvantages. In addition. each training package costs a number of development points(based upon the character's profession).</p>
<p><strong>Time to Acquire:</strong> This is the amount of time the character needs to train before gaining the benefits of the package. This time should be modified by a percentage equal to triple the character's SD bonus (expressed as a percentage).</p>
<p>For starting characters, total the amount of time spent in training packages and add it to the normal starting age to determine the starting age of the character (See <a href="5500.html#RMSR_17.1">Section 17.1</a> in <em>RMSR</em>).</p><p><strong>Starting Money:</strong> Some occupations (or lifestyles) have more or less starting money than others. Most packages list a modification to the "normal" starting money. This includes the starting type of coins (silver, gold, bronze, etc.). For example, if the normal starting money is 10 silver, the Adventurer package would have 10 silver plus d10 (open-ended) silver.</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There is one notation unique to the packages: d10 (open-ended). This means roll d10; if the result is 1 to 9, keep the result; if the result is a 10, roll d10 again and add it to 9; continue until a 10 is not the result.</blockquote>
<p>If the training package is developed after the Apprentice level, the starting money does not apply. When generating starting money, either the GM should make the rolls; or the player can simply take 51 (for each d100 roll) or 6 (for each d10 roll).</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> The GM should make a d100 roll (open-ended) for each item, adding the number in parenthesis after the item (the items should be rolled for in the order that they are presented). If the result is over 100, the character gains the special item or quirk. After successfully gaining one item, the chances of gaining any further items is halved (i.e. the number in parenthesis is halved). After successfully gaining another item, the next chance is halved again (repeating each time an item is gained). If no items are gained, the last item on the list is automatically gained (if the GM is unavailable to roll, the player should take the last item). If the package is developed after Apprentice level, the benefits gained here may be inappropriate (GM's discretion).</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The GM may choose to allow every character who develops a training package to have the last item in the list (even ifprevious items were gained).</blockquote>
<p><strong>Skill and Skill Category Ranks:</strong> All packages give some skill ranks and/or skill category ranks to the character. These skill ranks represent special training that comes with the occupation or lifestyle. Occasionally, the package will list Weapon/Attack. This means that the character can choose either a weapon skill rank or martial arts skill rank. In addition, a Training Package cannot raise a skill rank above 10<sup>th</sup> rank.</p>
<p><strong>Training Package Spell Lists:</strong> Certain training packages give ranks in training package spell Lists. Training package spell lists are a new category of skills in the <em>RMSS</em>. All training package spell lists are classified as Restricted skills unless the character is currently associated with the training package that awards ranks in that spell list. Note that "associated with" has no firm definition. The GM should judge whether is it reasonable for the character to still have normal access to the spells or not.</p><p>All training package spell lists are part of the Spell group (and will receive any profession bonuses appropriate to that group). There are two new categories that must be added to the Spell group to accomodate these new spells: <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Spells_Own_Realm_Training_Package">Spells &bull; Own Realm Training Package</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Spells_Other_Realm_Training_Package">Spells &bull; Other Realm Training Package</a>. The cost to develop Spells &bull; Own Realm Training Package is 8/8/8 for non-spell users, 4/4/4 for pure and hybrid spell users, and 6/6/6 for semi-spell users. The cost to develop Spells &bull; Other Realm Training Package is 16/16 for non-spell users, 8/8 for pure and hybrid spell users, and 12/ 12 for semi-spell users.</p>
<p><strong>Stat Gains:</strong> Some Training Packages allow the character to make extra stat gain rolls. This section shows which stats get the extra rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Background Options:</strong> You may spend a background option to decrease the cost of a training package for the Apprenticeship Development period only.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Qualifiers:</strong> This is a set of requirements that, ifthe character possesses all of the requirements prior to purchasing the training package, the character pays a lesser cost for the training package. The discount to the normal cost is shown after the qualifier.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle Skills:</strong> Normally, a training package cannot raise a skill above tenth rank. However, if a skill is designated as a Lifestyle skill, the training package ignores this limit and instead may raise the skill as high as fifteen ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Cost by Profession:</strong> This section shows how much the Training Package costs (in development points) for each profession. The professions are grouped by the books they were published in (starting with the professions in the <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>, then <a href="5600.html"><em>Arcane Companion</em></a>, then <a href="5601.html"><em>Treasure Companion</em></a>, then <a href="5602.html"><em>Martial Arts Companion</em></a>, then <a href="5603.html"><em>Essence Companion</em></a>, then <em>Channeling Companion</em>, then <a href="5700.html"><em>Black Ops</em></a>, then <a href="5701.html"><em>Pulp Adventures</em></a>).</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/11.1/THE STORY AND THE LUCK" -->
<h2><a name="CC_11.1">11.1</a> THE STORY AND THE LUCK</h2>
<p>In many great books and movies, the fictional characters seem to live a life of constant danger, surviving a hair's breath from death over and over again, but always living to complete their story.</p>
<p>As every <em>Rolemaster</em> player knows, an unlucky die roll can end that story quickly. Such unfortunate die rolls can lead to disenchantment with an otherwise enjoyable game. The constant fear of an unlucky demise may keep players from forming an attachment to their character, thus inhibiting them from role playing and developing their character fully.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is that a game without danger is no challenge, no fun, and ultimately without interest. Fear of death can make a game exiting.</p>
<p>One solution might be for the Gamemaster to just decide that because this is his game, that he will alter the events so they help the players. This is called the "Controlling the Story" or "Fudging the dice" method of Gamemastering. This could lead to frustration or boredom on the players part. The players may begin to think that the OM will save them every time something goes terribly wrong by altering the dice.</p>
<p>Presented here is an optional method of dealing with bad luck and unfortunate die rolls that the GM may not want in his game. The use of Fate Points, or the Gamemastering method of"Controlling the Luck" is a new way to deal with this. These rules are optional. Whether they are used wilI depend on the type of game being played. If a GM has an austere game, where characters are constantly faced with death at every tum, he may use very few of these rules. However, a GM who has very intricate plot lines worked out far in advance, but sees his players drop like flies to unlucky critical hits, may be more inclined to use these rules. Again, the use of these rules in entirely optional and will ultimately depend on the GM and the gaming style he uses.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/11.2/WHY USE FATE POINTS?" -->
<h2><a name="CC_11.2">11.2</a> WHY YSE FATE POINTS?</h2>
<p>A GM might want to control the luck with Fate Points for many reasons that are outlined below.</p>
<p>The first reason is that the <em>RMSS</em> can be deadly. One look at any <em>Rolemaster</em> critical table wilI telI you that the chances of dying when you suffer a 'D' or an 'E' critical are quite high. Depending on the type of campaign you are playing in, a fierce and pitched battle (even if you play defensive) could possibly inflict a few 'C' and 'D' criticals, and maybe even an 'E' critical on your favorite character. The odds of that character surviving that one battle are not very good. Now think of that character surviving many battles that session. How about multiple sessions? The GM may be looking for a way to tone down the deadliness of the game.</p>
<p>The second reason, is that not everyone always wants to play a healing character. Healers can work very welI healing the wounds that the critical hit charts inflict, but to cure some ofthe deadlier criticals, they have to be very high level. There are some criticals that they will never be able to cure. Not every gaming group has a player that wants to be of a healing profession. How many times have you been choosing a profession, only to have the rest of the party members (who have already chosen their professions) clamor that the group really needs a healing character? Should you be forced to playa Healer when you have realIy been wanting to playa Magent? The GM may not want to force anyone to playa healing character, and thus he may want some additional control over the luck of his game.</p>
<p>The third reason, is that the players might always seem to kilI the enemy that the GM wants to use in future story lines and plots. This can frustrate a GM's welI laid plans. Fate Points are for NPC's as welI. The GM may want to ensure that a particular NPC stays alive for use in later storylines.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/11.3/THE SOURCE OF FATE POINTS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_11.3">11.3</a> THE SOURCE OF FATE POINTS</h2>
<p>What is the source of Fate Points? If something does stop a death critical from happening, what force did it? Combat with deadly weapons and spells is just as deadly (if not more so) than the <em>Rolemaster</em> critical hit tables depict it. A GM could just say that it was just a character's destiny, or part of that characters luck, that saved him from death. However, that theory plays down the accuracy of the <em>Rolemaster</em> system.</p>
<p>AlI of a character's abilities are assumed to be included in his profession, talents, etc. If something stepped in, and stopped the critical from happening, it was some sort of outside source like a deity or some other sort of higher power protecting a character's fate. At the very least it was some mystical, unknowing spiritual force that sometimes helps people when they need it.</p>
<p>The concept presented here is that when someone uses a Fate Point, they are using up some of their divinely granted fate, which alI beings have. Exactly what deities or beings are in charge of fate, and how much fate each being gets, is up to the GM.</p><p>Whether a character has a religion or not, they have Fate Points. Every mission that a character performs is likely to be of interest to some kind of deity. There may be a deity ofFate or Luck that controls everyone's destiny, giving alI mortals Fate Points as he sees fit. Most fantasy campaigns have the characters as heroes, affecting the lives of many others. This would not go unnoticed to certain deities, that may want these characters alive for many different reasons. It may also be that the main deities of "good" and "evil" in a world are in charge of fate.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/11.4/ACQUIRING FATE POINTS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_11.4">11.4</a> ACQUIRING FATE POINTS</h2>
<p>How many Fate Points should characters begin with? It might depend on how much time your group spends fighting. I f they are going to spend many sessions in all-out war, they may need many. Ifyou have a game more geared towards role playing, then you may not need to give out as many. Use the chart below to detennine how many Fate Points to award starting characters.</p>
<p>You may also want to let your players acquire new Fate Points as they adventure. A GM has many options to giving out new Fate Points. You may want to give out a certain number of starting Fate Points and let them stand for the entire campaign. You may want to give out one Fate Point per experience level, or one every other level. Another option is to give them out when a character does something truly heroic, or fulfills a lifetime goal. You could, on rare occasions, give one to each party member when the party has finished an extraordinary mission together. Use the chart below to dctennine how often to award additional Fate Points as the game progresses.</p>
<p>An additional way to give out Fate Points is to give them to any PC that forces an NPC to use one to save his life. Important NPC' s will have Fate Points as well as the PC's. It can be frustrating for a player, if they inflict a great critical to an important NPC that the Gamemaster has given Fate Points, for the NPC will just use his Fate Points to avoid it. I f a player gives a critical to an NPC, and the NPC uses a Fate Point to survive, the GM could award that Fate Point to the character. The reverse should also apply; an NPC should gain the Fate Points that he makes the PC's use. This system rewards the characters when they fatally wound an NPC, who would otherwise have died.</p>

<h2><a name="CC_11.5">11.5</a> USES OF FATE POINTS</h2>
<p>When a player uses a Fate Point, they can re-roll a roll which has to do with a critical hit or spell or other maneuver that might kill his character. Specifically, Fate Points are usually used for the following: re-rolling a critical, re-rolling a resistance roll, or re-rolling a maneuver roll. They can also be used in situations where it is sure that they would die, if the roll is not made.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_11.5.0.0.1">11.5.0.0.1</a> Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Kalon receives an unlucky "100" critical while defending his homeland from goblins. He uses one of his Fate Points to have the critical re-rollcd.</p></li>
<li><p>Jerion fails his RR vs. an <em>Absolution</em> spell cast by an evil <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a>. He is the last member of his party standing. Should he fall, he would die, and all of his companions would be killed as well. He spends a Fate Point and gets to re-roll his RR.</p></li>
<li><p>Gauge is making a climbing roll to get away from some wolves that he has happened upon. He is almost near the top, when he rolls a bad result that might result in his death (by the fall or by the wolves). The GM allows him to re-roll the maneuver roll with a Fate Point.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fate Points cannot help in all situations and with all rolls. First, Fate points are not to be used in a directly offensive manner. The idea is that Fate Points are a way to keep the character from dying, not to give them power over their attacks and critical hits that they give to others. Second, they do not help with situations that do not have to do with the survival of the character.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_11.5.0.0.2">11.5.0.0.2</a> Examples</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Mozad's last attack agains this enemy is a fumble, where his weapon flies from his grasp. He knows that he is running away with his friends next round, and asks the GM ifhe can re-roll his attack with a Fate Point to keep his weapon. The GM tells Mozad to get another weapon back in town.</p></li>
<li><p>The "Giant Slayers," a well-known group of adventurers enters a Fire Giant stronghold. They use a few Fate Points to re-roll criticals, but their party starts to die off due to the great concussion hit damage from the Fire Giant's swords. Fate Points do not help. Better chose wiser next time.</p></li>
<li><p>Burrik is tired and wounded. He engages his mortal enemy in combat, but cannot hit him due to his wounds and fatigue. Fate Points will not help with his attacks. He will have to fight him another day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the players get into a situation where they will all die Ifthey do not kill an enemy, then they should notbe fighting him in the first place. If they get trapped in an evil <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Magician's</a> tower, and need to escape, they should have never ventured into the tower in the first place. There are a hundred ways for characters to die, that have nothing to do with unlucky die rolls. These ways to die have more to do with the bad decisions of the characters, and Fate Points will not help at all. GMs that use Fate Points are encouraged to keep death a very real factor in games, while at the same time easing the burden of bad luck the game can sometimes put on their shoulders.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/11.6/FATE POINT OPTIONAL RULES" -->
<h2><a name="CC_11.6">11.6</a> FATE POINT OPTIONAL RULES</h2>
<p>There are a few more optional rules and decisions associated with Fate Points.</p>
<p>The first, is the "Two Fate Point" rule. When the dice are rolled for the second time, they could come up unfavorable again for the character. If a PC or an NPC uses a second Fate Point on the same critical, RR or other roll, the effect is simply canceled, not rolled a third time. All concussion hit damage from any attack still applies.</p>
<p>The second, is "Control Overthe Use ofFate Points." Will the players be allowed to decide for themselves when to use their Fate Points? The GM could set up strict guidelines for Fate Point usage, or they could be allowed to decide for themselves if and when to use them. One such control rule could be that players can only use their Fate Points when they are going to die instantly from a critical. However, sometimes a character receives a critical that states that they are stunned until eternity, bleeding a river, or are at negative infinity to attack. Sure, they will survive the critical, but will they survive the rest ofthe battle? That character might want to use a Fate Point to re-roll that critical.</p>
<p>Giving the players the choice of when to use Fate Points will give them more control over the game. A GM should be prepared for that. Ignoring criticals can obviously be used in an indirectly offensive way. If the characters all decide that a certain Sorcerer just has to die, they may all use their Fate Points to resist him, and to quickly kill him. The GM should make these major decisions about Fate Points early on in his game.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/11.7/USEFULNESS OF FATE POINTS" -->
<p>Fate Points are extremely useful to the GM for story purposes, and very helpful if you want a plot that flows like your favorite movie or book. Fate Points will allow fights with the main enemies of the campaign, or with very powerful beings to happen without the creatures slaughtering the whole party. A few Fate Points may bc spent as the party runs away, or the party <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Magician</a> prepares <em>Teleport V</em>, but the party will have built up an interesting history with the evil villains of the campaign.</p>
<p>There are also times that the GM just throws too many monsters at the party. No GM is perfect, and sometimes he makes mistakes. Gamemasters do not have to fudge any dice rolls ifthey have given out Fate Points. The PCs canjust use them as they need to, so that they can win the fight or run away. Fate Points can act as a cushion against situations where otherwise the whole party would be massacred.</p>
<p>Fate Points can also be a great way for the GM to protect those NPC villains that he wants to be a long-lasting part of the campaign. There are obviously times where, as a GM, you do not want a certain NPC to die, as he may be crucial to future story lines, or you just plain do not want him to die with a lucky PC attack roll. Give him Fate Points and he will become more difficult and challenging to defeat.</p>
<p>What Fate Points will not do, is give the PC's a free ride, by removing danger from a game. Dangerous campaigns can be very fun. If your players like danger, you certainly do not want to remove it from the game. You just want to give the players a bit of freedom from terrible luck.</p>
<p>The goal of Fate Points is not to remove the elements of bad luck or danger from a game. The goal is to protect the game at certain spots, while retaining the element of danger in others.</p>
<p>Optimally, Fate Points should be used in such a way that in routine situations, not directly relevant to the story, such as wandering monsters, unimportant encounters, etc., death is not very probable. However, you want to make sure that in situations key to the story, death is a very real danger.

<h2><a name="CC_12.1">12.1</a> SPIRIT WORLD DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The spirit world is a conceptual plane. This makes any description of the spirit world dependent upon the person describing it. However, it does have some things that are common to all perceptions of it. The air is always filled with a swirling mist that scintillates with ever-shifting colors (some that are unique to the spirit world). The landscape appears to be a reflection of the physical world, but it will vary slightly with each visitor.</p>
<p>The spirit world is also filled with crossover points, or windows, to other worlds or planes. For the most part, the spirits tend to avoid these locations, as travel through these portals can taint the spirit. The spirits of the dead will pass through the Spirit World on their way their way to the final resting place of their religion.</p>
<p>A character who visits the spirit world will appear, to himself, as he believes himselfto appear. To anybody else on this plane, he will appear as they view him, differently for each person. The spirits themselves may appear in any form that they wish, though most of the time, that form is related to the abilities of the spirit. A Fire Spirit may appear as a humanoid figure of flame, but its size is determined by its power (i.e., level). As a spirit grows in power, it also grows in size.</p>
<p>The mist that covers this plane is actually filled with various spirits who have not taken a form yet. These spirits do not interact with visitors to the spirit world. These spirits are seen as only a quick flash of color.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/12.2/TAINT" -->
<h2><a name="CC_12.2">12.2</a> TAINT</h2>
<p>Spirits are interested in purity, be it ofthought, emotion, ideal, or action. They continually strive to achieve this purity. Contact with physical beings can taint this purity. When a spirit receives taint the taint will start to alter that spirit's personality. The more taint a spirit has, the closer it is to becoming an Angry Spirit (see below). A spirit can have a total number of taint levels equal to twice its level before it becomes angry (e.g., a third level spirit can sustain six levels of taint, at which point it is turned into an Angry Spirit).</p>
<p>Whenever a spirit comes into contact with a person or object in the physical world, it must check to see if it has been tainted. Each time that a spirit interacts with something or somebody from the physical world, the spirit must make a RR versus its own level. This roll is modified by -5 for every interaction above the first encountered at one time, and by -5 for every level of taint already incurred.</p>
<p>When a character casts Cleansing Chant upon himself, it gives the spirit an additional +50 to his RR versus any tainting from contact with the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Shaman">Shaman</a>.</p>
<p>The character can remove taint from a spirit by casting Purification Chant upon the spirit. Each level of taint that a spirit has gives it a +5 to its resistance roll to this purification attempt. This RR is required, even if the spirit is willing, and it does not get the normal -50 modifier for a willing target under any circumstances. It can be difficult for a powerful Angry Spirit to be purified and calmed.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/12.3/SPIRIT DESCRIPTIONS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_12.3">12.3</a> SPIRIT DESCRIPTIONS</h2>
<p>This section will give a more detailed description of several types of spirits. This list is not exhaustive by any means, but it will give the OM a fair idea of some of thepossibilities.</p>
<p>Spirits can be found both in the spirit world and the physical world. Those found in the physical world are those who are either tied to a physical location (see below), or those who are lost and wandering aimlessly. The spirits found in the spirit world most often will be those that live there, but it is possible that those who visit this realm may encounter each other.</p>
<p>All spirits from the spirit world will have a wavering, insubstantial form when on the physical plane. When in the spirit world, their forms will seem solid, just as that of a Shaman's feels solid. The actual shapes and details of a spirit are determined by the nature of the spirit.</p>
<p>Certain spirits do have a physical form when walking the mortal realms ofthe physical world. These spirits are most often tied to a specific location. These include some rural spirits (e.g., Dryads or Nixies). Most of these types of spirits have specific entries in <a href="5541.html"><em>Creatures & Monsters</em></a>.</p>
<p>Please note that some spirits may fall into more than one category of description. It is up to the GM to determine the details ofeach spirit, as they will always be unique, even if they are of the same type as another spirit. It is also important to note that while there are multitudes of spirit types, there is also an almost limitless number of spirits for each type.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.1">12.3.0.0.1</a> Angry Spirits</h5>
<p>When a spirit gains a level oftaint equal to or greater than twice its level, it is turned into an Angry Spirit. An Angry Spirit is one that has been twisted by the taint received by interacting with the physical world. These spirits will do their best to destroy everything and everyone they encounter. Their form will always be a warped version of their normal form. An Angry Spirit will attack using either possession or an innate ability (see <a href="#CC_12.4">Section 12.4</a>).</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.2">12.3.0.0.2</a> Conceptual Spirits</h5>
<p>Sometimes a special concept can seem to have a life all its own. This is quite possible when dealing with the spirit world. Conceptual Spirits are those spirits that embody the goals and ideals of a certain concept, which can include almost anything (such as Christmas Past), or even a single event (such as a murder or a marriage ceremony). These spirits will attack either by using possession or emanation (see <a href="#CC_12.4">Section 12.4</a>).</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.3">12.3.0.0.3</a> Elemental Spirits</h5>
<p>Earth, Fire, Water, Air, Light, and Dark (the elements found in nature) each have their own spirits. While being of an elemental nature, they are not Elementals. They will come in many various shapes and sizes and embody the essence or nature of the elements, rather than the force of the elements themselves. These spirits will make attacks by either emanation or inundation (see <a href="#CC_12.4">Section 12.4</a>).</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.4">12.3.0.0.4</a> Emotive Spirits</h5>
<p>Primitive, raw emotions are embodied by these spirits. Those who fall prey to these spirits are overcome by that single emotion driving the spirit. These spirits attack using possession or emanation (see <a href="#CC_12.4">Section 12.4</a>).</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.5">12.3.0.0.5</a> Haunts</h5>
<p>These spirits are full ofdistress, rage, and grief. They are usually brought into being after a traumatic experiences during life: a violent death, a betrayal, or a tortured existence. These poor spirits are often tied to the location oftheir creation. Yearning for release to the spirit world and cessation of their pain, they will attack any who come within range. Using possession and emanation to attack (see <a href="#CC_12.4">Section 12.4</a>), they can be very dangerous. Those affected by the attacks of these spirits suffer the re-enactment of the event that created this spirit.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.6">12.3.0.0.6</a> Rational Spirits</h5>
<p>Cold, hard logic defines these spirits. They are rarely swayed once they have decided upon a course of action. The bane of all emotion, these spirits may be swayed only through the use oflogic. When attacking, these spirits will almost always use possession (see <a href="#CC_12.4">Section 12.4</a>).</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.7">12.3.0.0.7</a> Shaman Spirits</h5>
<p>In some cases, a Shaman will enter the spirit world never to return to the physical world. These Shamen may do this for a variety of reasons , be iton purpose or by accident. The spirits of past Shamans retain all abilities and skills they had when alive. Fortunately for those who travel the spirit world, the Shaman Spirits have little to do with anybody else in the spirit world. They believe themselves to be ahove the concerns of the mortal world.</p>
<p>If a Shaman Spirit decides to attack, it will use all of its abilities as well as possession (see <a href="#CC_12.4">Section 12.4</a>). If a Shaman Spirit successfully possesses a physical body, he can use his abilities through that body, and has access to the thoughts and memories of his host. This acquisition of knowledge is unique to the Shaman Spirit (other spirits using possession cannot do this).</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.8">12.3.0.0.8</a> Standard Spirits</h5>
<p>Standard Spirits are often called Unborn Spirits by Shaman. These spirits have no focus or theme that defines them. They will actually change into a spirit of an appropriate type ifthey encounter enough taint from the physical world, oreven from other spirits. It is important to note that Unborn Spirits can only receive a number of levels of taint equal to its level, rather than twice its level, before transforming into another type of spirit. Unborn Spirits have no attacks until they become another type of spirit.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.9">12.3.0.0.9</a> Thematic Spirits</h5>
<p>Thematic Spirits are tied to specific locations on the physical world. Highly complex spirits, they exemplify individual themes or ideals. These spirits are usually found at points where the physical world and the spirit world cross over and connect. When they appear on the physical world, these spirits assume physical forms. The forms that a Thematic Spirit takes on determines its method of attack on the physical world. In the spirit world, these spirits are treated just like Conceptual Spirits.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.3.0.0.10">12.3.0.0.10</a> Totem Spirits</h5>
<p>Totem Spirits are of the most complex spmts ever encountered by any anyone. They represent a given goal, theme, and/or ideal. Theoretically, there is a Totem Spirit for every idea ever conceived, but these spirits are active in cycles, each totem having dominance only on certain occasions, and only in certain locations.</p>
<p>Totem Spirits have the unique ability to travel freely from the spirit world to the physical world. While in the physical world, they take the form of the animal or creature that might represent their ideology. A Totem Spirit in its physical manifestation has all of the strengths and weaknesses of the form it takes. It also has the natural enemies and allies of that form. While on the physical world, the only attacks a Totem Spirit has are the natural attacks of their form (though a few are capable of bringing a few mystical abilities to use on the physical world). When they travel to the spirit world, they retain a spirit form that matches their physical form. In the spirit world, they may only use possession to attack (see <a href="#CC_12.4">Section 12.4</a>).</p>
<p>Totem Spirits also grant special abilities to the character that they choose to follow when they become Totem Familiars. These special abilities are dependent upon the ideology of the totem.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/12.4/SPIRIT COMBAT" -->
<h2><a name="CC_12.4">12.4</a> SPIRIT COMBAT</h2>
<p>Spirits have several fonns of combat. Not every spirit may use every type of attack. Usually, a spirit will be limited to one or two attack fonns. While spirits use similar fonns to attack, the results of those attacks will depend upon the spirit who is attacking. The attack forms are listed below, with a short description of each.</p>
<p><strong>Emanation</strong>&mdash;When a spirit attacks by emanation, it creates an area equal to 10' radius per level of the spirit centered on the spirit, in which all persons and creatures must make a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> RR versus the level of the spirit or be overcome by the attack ofthe spirit, (e.g., if a Spirit of Hunger makes an emanation attack, all who fail the RR will be overcome by feelings of hunger).</p>
<p><strong>Inundation</strong>&mdash;This attack form is limited to Elemental Spirits. An Elemental Spirit may make this type of attack at a range of up to 100' away, and it covers an area equal to a I' radius per level of the spirit. If any creature or person within that radius fails a Channeling RR versus the level of the spirit, they will be affected by the attack of the spirit. Each Elemental Spirit has its own method of inundation. An example ofthe types ofeffects generated by this attack fonn are listed below. Each element has several aspects, and the examples presented do not fonn a complete list, they only show possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>An Elemental Spirit of Earth could cause all within the area of effect to feel the solidity and weight of the world bearing down upon their every sense, slowing down thought and actions to almost nothing. This might have an effect similar to that of a Hold Kind spell.</p></li>
<li><p>An Elemental Spirit of Fire could cause all within the area of effect to feel the quick, mercurial nature of a flame. Thoughts, feelings, and actions are all impulsive and reactionary. This could have the effect of driving all within the area into a berserk frenzy.</p></li>
<li><p>An Elemental Spirit ofWater could cause all within the area to feel the flexibility and compromising nature of the depths. Any decisions made while affected by this spirit might seem to be most reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>An Elemental Spirit of Air could cause all within its effect to feel the clarity, conciseness, and rapidity of thought. Translating thought into action might be easy, thus enabling those affected to spri ng into acti on at a greater speed than those not affected.</p></li>
<li><p>An Elemental Spirit ofLight could bring with it the harmony and tranquillity of oneness with the universe, an acceptance of circumstances, and the sureness of inner peace.</p></li>
<li><p>An Elemental Spirit of Dark could bring with it the coldness and the despair of things shadowy, thus making action of any sort seem futile at best.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Possession</strong>&mdash;Some spirits will try to take over the corporeal fonn of a person. To do this they will try to possess that person's body, removing the target's mind from command. The spirit will try to enter the body ofthe target and take over. When this occurs, the target must make a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> RR versus the level of the spirit. Once a spirit has successfully taken over a target, he may use the body of the target for up to ten minutes per level of the spirit, at which point the effort of controlling another's fonn becomes too much.</p>
<p>During this time, the target of the possession may make an additional RR for every ten minutes that he is under the control of the spirit, and also if his body gets injured in any way.</p>
<p>While in control of the target's body, the spirit has no access to the target's knowledge or skills (except the Shaman Spirit as noted above). The target is also aware of all actions taken by the spirit.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_12.4.0.0.1">12.4.0.0.1</a> Spirit Statistics</h5>
<p>While there are a great multitude of types of spirits that may be encountered, they all have several things in common. Use the following set of stats as a base for developing a spirit.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/12.5/TOTEM FAMILIARS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_12.5">12.5</a> TOTEM FAMILIARS</h2>
<p>When a character casts the spell Totem Familiar, it sends a call out to the spirit world. This call contains a blueprint of the personality and ideology of the caster. This call may be answered by a Totem Spirit of a similar mentality (roll on the Totem Familiar chart below for the type offamiliar). If answered, it will always be a first-level spirit that appears before the caster. This Totem Familiar will again level each time the caster gains a level. Should the caster ever lose his Totem Familiar, and recast this spell, he will always gain another Totem Familiar ofthe same type, again at first level of ability.</p>
<p>A Totem Familiar grants the character special abilities, as well as having abilities of its own to use for the benefit of the character. These abilities need not be the same as what it grants the character. These conferred powers are granted to the Shaman for use in pursuit of its ideology and goals. Each totem grants a different conferred power that grows in strength as the Totem Spirit grows in power. These powers are highly subjective in nature, and should be considered carefully by the GM so as not to unbalance his game.</p>
<p>Examples of conferred powers could include anyone of the following list. But it is important to remember that the Totem Familiar only grants one power to the character, and if that Totem Familiar is ever lost, the character would lose that ability.</p>
<p><strong>Stat bonuses</strong>&mdash;These should start out at +1 to the stat bonus and increase by +1 for every three levels theTotem Spirit gains.</p>
<p><strong>Skill bonuses</strong>&mdash;This should be a +2 per level of the totem for some skill related to the ideology of the totem. This should not affect skill categories, and should be limited to only one skill per level of the totem.</p>
<p><strong>Spell ability</strong>&mdash;Certain totems may grant a spell list to the character. This should be a very rare occurrence, and the character should only have access to the list up to the level of the totem. It is also very important to ensure that all spells on a list adhere to the ideology of the totem. If a spell doesn't fit, the totem will not grant a spell for that level.</p>
<p><strong>Trait enhancement</strong>&mdash;The character could have a certain trait enhanced by his totem. This is very subjective and should only apply to situations when the character was furthering the cause of the totem. For example, the totem may increase a characters fearlessness to help counteract a fear-causing spell, ifdoing so helped further the totem's cause.</p>
<p>This is just a sample of what a totem could grant to a character. The actual possibilities expand much further. The totem could grant an ability that was spell-like in' nature that started off small and grew with the totem. These granted abilities are accessible to the character only when the totem is within range. This range is equal to 10' per level of the totem.</p>
<p>The totem and the character also share a couple of combined abilities. The first is that the character and Totem Familiar will each know in which direction the other is, no matter the distance. The second is that with concentration, the Totem Familiar and the character may view the world using each others' senses. This can be initiated by either, and only works as long as they are within range of each other.</p>
<p>The totem will have its own special abilities, which could mirror those granted to the character or could be completely different.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while the totem will often do as the character asks, it is dedicated to furthering its ideology. This could cause the character some problems, as the Totem Familiar will always be working towards its own ends. It is also important to note that while the Totem Familiar will understand everything that the character says, it is limited by its physical form when communicating with the character.</p>

<h1><a name="CC_13.0">13.0</a> TALENTS AND FLAWS</h1>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/talents.html">Talents</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html#">flaws</a> of characters can be explained in a variety of ways, from natural ability, to special training, and in the case of a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a>, possibly a granted power or ability bestowed by a deity. Flaws could be explained the same way. When selecting talents and flaws for a character, the GM and player should keep in mind the general nature and purpose of the <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user. Talents which would obviously go against that nature should not be selected. For example, a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Magic</a> would probably never have the "<a href="../en.lproj/talents.html#Unbeliever">Unbeliever</a>" talent, but might be much more likely to have the "<a href="../en.lproj/talents.html#Aura">Aura</a>" talent.</p>
<p>Flaws are a bit more objective. It is entirely possible that a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Druid">Druid</a> may have the '<a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html#Animal_Bane">Animal Bane</a>' flaw or a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Light</a> may have the "<a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html#Blind">Blind</a>" flaw. Such instances could make for some great role-playing as the character strives to work with his flaw. Naturally the "<a href="../en.lproj/talents.html#Priestly_Investment">Priestly Investment</a>" talent would be a good choice for any <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> profession variant. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Light</a> may have both the "<a href="../en.lproj/talents.html#Flare">Flare</a>" talent and the "<a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html#Visible_Aura">Visible Aura</a>" flaw. Further suggestions could include a <A href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Fire</A> that has the "<a href="../en.lproj/talents.html#Power_Absorption">Power Absorption (Fire)</a>" talent yet is more susceptible to forms of cold, which could be simulated by the "<a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html#Cold_Sensitive">Cold Sensitive</a>" flaw and even by going so far as to reverse the "<a href="../en.lproj/talents.html#Power_Absorption">Power Absorption</a>" talent so that it works in the opposite manner versus cold (i.e., it becomes a flaw of equal status; maybe called it "<a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html#Power_Susceptible">Power Susceptible</a>"). Be creative.</p>
<p>Some flaws may be overcome over the course of a character's career, but others he will be stuck with for life. In the case of a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Fire</a>, he may have the above mentioned "<a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html#Power_Susceptible">Power Susceptible</a>" verses cold flaw and the "<a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html#Pyromaniac">Pyromaniac</a>" flaw. Over time, the character could learn to control his fascination with fire and stop himself from setting fires at random, but so long as he is a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Fire</a>, he will never be rid of the "<a href="../en.lproj/flaws.html#Power_Susceptible">Power Susceptible</a>" flaw. If GM's allow PCs to "overcome" a flaw, a new flaw should be given to the character (equal in weight to the old flaw) or, optionally, an equal talent may be lost.</p>
<p>As always, if players have picked flaws that do not actually restrict their characters in any real way, the Gamemaster should feel free to have the player choose or roll for another flaw or choose one for them.</p>

<h1><a name="CC_14.0">14.0</a> RESTRICTING CHANNELING</h1>
<p>One ofthe hallmarks of the <em>Rolemaster Standard System</em> is the ability to develop ranks in any skill regardless of profession or race. This gives players the opportunity to individualize a character in any way that player wants, which results in endless possibilities for potential character types. Overall, there should be no official system rules on the availability ofany particular skill to anyone profession or race. However, other factors decided by the gamemaster, may take into account the availability and difficulty to learn those skills.</p>
<p>The one possible exception to this theory are the spell lists in the realm of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>. The following is a set of optional rules for restricting the availability of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic. The deciding factors on who can be allowed access to <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic will be the character's realm, his "religiousness" and his devotion to his deity. The following rules cover the all the ways that characters can access <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic (i.e., using Development Points, purchasing training packages, etc.).</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> GM's who want to avoid absolute restrictions can simply make certain skills Restrictedfor development.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="CC_14.1">14.1</a> INSIDE THE REALM</h2>
<p>What if a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user desires to learn another <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user's base lists? What if a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Necromancer">Necromancer</a> wants to inspire his Undead minions using the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin's</a> <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_2.5.6"><em>Inspirations</em></a> base spell list?</p>
<p>The first proposed restriction is that <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell users not be allowed to develop ranks in other <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user's base lists, if they are diametrically opposed to their deity's nature. For example, a deity of death and destruction might not grant his followers access to healing spell lists. The character's deity would simply not channel him the power for those spells.</p>
<p>The second restriction is that a GM might want to restrict access to all <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> base lists because those <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> base lists reflect the power given to those Channelers who dedicate their whole lives to worshipping the one deity that can provide those spells. The GM is thus ruling that the only source of power for those <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> base list spells is the one deity that provides them. Thus, no one else can access the source of power for those spells without worshiping that deity. It is also possible that a character's deity may not want a Channeler learning spells that are not part of the religion, and he may prevent the Channeler from learning them. It depends on the Gamemaster's world view. If the deities in his world are the only source of a Channeling base list, then the matter is settled.</p>

<h1><a name="CC_15.0">15.0</a> MISCELANEOUS TOPICS</h1>
<p>This section covers a variety of other miscellaneous topics that pertain to various aspects of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/15.1/CHANNELING RITUALS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_15.1">15.1</a> CHANNELING RITUALS</h2>
<p>When a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user wants to accomplish an extraordinary feat of magic using the channeled power of their deity, they will be required to perform a magic ritual. These magic rituals take longer to perform normal spells, but can be much more powerful.</p>
<p>If the ritual is required by the deity to cast a certain spell, it is called a standard ritual. If the ritual and channeled power has been requested by the character, it is a non-standard ritual.</p>
<p>The following rules have been created to be compatible with <a href="5603.html#EC_9.0">Section 9.0 in the Essence Companion</a>, while trying to reflect the difference between the two realms. Unless indicated below, use all of the rules from the <em>Essence Companion</em>. The only major change is to remove the negative modifiers to all <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> rituals given in that section if the magic ritual is being performed by a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell user.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.1.0.0.1">15.1.0.0.1</a> Standard Rituals</h5>
<p>Many deities may require that certain high level spells be accompanied by a ritual every time they are cast. Only extraordinary spells should require a ritual. In addition, only spells from base lists would require a ritual, never spells from an open or closed list.</p>
<p>The following is a list of spells that the GM might consider requiring a magic ritual roll to succeed:</p>
<p>Lifegiving, Animal Reviving, Holy Bridge, Ritual of Black Eternity, Gate, City Curse, Kingdom Curse, Quake, Time Walk, and Forest's Cause, though there are many other spells that a GM might consider adding to this list depending on the power level of the spell.</p>
<p>These are existing spells, and as such, do not change any natural spell effects. However, many of these spells perform extraordinary effects that require a ritual and the direct cooperation of the caster's deity.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.1.0.0.2">15.1.0.0.2</a> Non-Standard Rituals</h5>
<p>There may arise times where a Channeler or a group of Channelers with the same religion may want to perform a spell or spell-like effect that goes further than their normal abilities and powers.</p>
<p>The reasons that a Channeler might want to perform this type of magic ritual are many. First, they may want to produce an effect that is not covered by any spell. Second, they may want to stretch the bounds of an existing spell to perform a special task. Third, they may want to perform some feat ofmagic that goes well past what one Channeler alone can normally do with his spells and power.</p>
<p>In all cases, a ritual is what is called for, because a sudden burst of Channeled power from a deity might kill a character, while the slow build up of the power involved in a ritual can be handled by a mortal, or group of mortals.</p>
<p>When a Channeler attempts to perform a magic ritual of this type, they are asking a deity to give them something more than their normal spells. In a very minor way, they are asking for Divine Intervention. They are not asking a deity to directly help, but they are asking for additional power, and for control over their spells. Thus, if the GM feels that the Channeler is asking for too much power, he may make him resolve the ritual as a Divine Intervention Maneuver instead.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.1.0.0.3">15.1.0.0.3</a> Influences and Distractions</h5>
<p>Influences and Distractions work the same as they do in the <em>Essence Companion</em>, adding to and subtracting from the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Magic_Ritual">Magic Ritual</a> Maneuver. What should be included as Influences and Distractions will be different for each religion. One example follows:</p>
<p>This example only shows one religion. Each religion will have different Influences and Distractions appropriate to their faith and their deity's Sphere of Influence. For example, a Lifegiving ritual might work better if friends and family of the deceased were present. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of nature</a> would require herbs and seeds for his rituals, and a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of death</a> might need skulls.</p>
<p>In addition, if a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> ritual matches closely with an <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell category, then feel free to use modifications from that category. For instance, any ritual that changes a Darkness spell could use the Dark category influences and distractions.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.1.0.0.4">15.1.0.0.4</a> Multiple Spell Users</h5>
<p>If multiple spell users are to be used in the ritual, they must be of the same religion as the spell user who is to be the performer of the ritual. All participants expend the same number of power points as the performer of the ritual. A performer of a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> ritual can only include as many spell users in his ritual as he has levels of Ritual magic divided by 3 (i.e., with 12 ranks, he may include 4 extra spell users in his ritual). If the Divine Status of the spell users is low, the GM may deem that no bonus is gained.</p>
<p>The bonus for including additional participants in the ritual is as follows.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.1.0.0.5">15.1.0.0.5</a> Ritual Skill</h5>
<p>In the realm of <span id="essence">Essence</span>, there are many different ritual classes in which an <span id="essence">Essence</span> user must develop skill separately. For the realm of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>, the Channeler has to develop skill in each and every type of ritual that he wants to perform (e.g., Lifegiving, City Curse).</p>
<p>If the ritual is a standard ritual, and is on the character's base lists, then the skill for this ritual is classified as an Everyman skill. Any ritual done with another profession's base lists is to be considered a Restricted skill.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.1.0.0.6">15.1.0.0.6</a> Hybrid Spell Users</h5>
<p>Hybrid spell users will use the <span id="essence">Essence</span> ritual magic rules for when they want to perform a ritual that only uses a spell or spell-like effect from the realm of <span id="essence">Essence</span>. Similarly, for any <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> list, they will use these rules only.</p>
<p>When they want to perform a spell or spell-like effect with their base lists, they are able to use their <span id="essemce">Essence</span> skills to perform the ritual, as they are also able to use both the Influences and Distractions from their <span id="essence">Essence</span> ritual class and their specific religion's Influences and Distraction. They are also be able to use multiple participants in the ritual.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/15.2/ENEMIES, DARKNESS, AND EVIL" -->
<h2><a name="CC_15.2">15.2</a> ENEMIES, DARKNESS, AND EVIL</h2>
<p>Throughout the <em>RMSS</em>, there are references to "enemies," creatures "of darkness," and "evil" creatures. They usually refer to who or what can be affected by certain types of spells and abilities. This section will explain what is meant by these three terms.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.2.0.0.1">15.2.0.0.1</a> Enemies</h5>
<p>This term is very specific. The Gamemaster has final say on what is meant by an "enemy" to each particular faith. Those who actively oppose a religion or its deity on a regular basis are certainly enemies, as are Channelers of diametrically opposing faiths. For a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Fire</a>, creatures of ice or cold may qualify as enemies, as well as <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priests of Ice</a>. For a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Life</a>, Undead would be enemies, etc.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Dalinor is a Priest ofLight. His enemies would be any Priest of Darkness, and any who are directly working with that faith to fight against his. Also enemies to Dalinor, are any creatures composed entirely of shadow.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="CC_15.2.0.0.2">15.2.0.0.2</a> Creatures "Of Darkness"</h5>
<p>This term is much broader than "enemies." Creatures "of darkness" can be specific to each GM's world, but a few should probably be constant. Spell Law defines "of darkness" as something that is of "evil" origins (regardless of whether the thing itself is evil or not). Undead should always be considered creatures of darkness. Demons should almost always be considered creatures of darkness. The GM could also consider some Channelers of opposing faiths to be "of darkness." Other such creatures as the GM dictates could also be creatures "of darkness." Note the character's enemies are not necessarily "of darkness."</p>
<p>As an optional rule, treat creatures or characters with corruption points as creatures of darkness. If 100 corruption points represents a totally evil or corrupt creature, a d100 roll could be used to resolve a spell effect that involves creatures of darkness. Roll d100 (not open-ended) and add the creature/character's corruption points. If the result is over 100 the target is considered "of darkness." This roll should be made as often as the effect requiring the roll dictates. For example, Holy Aura I requires a roll every round.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> To Dalinor, all his enemies are "of Darkness." In addition, all Undead and Demons are also "of Darkness".</blockquote>
<h5><a name="CC_15.2.0.0.3">15.2.0.0.3</a> Evil Creatures</h5>
<p>This is the broadest term of the three. If the cleric is good, his "enemies" and creatures "of darkness" would both qualify as evil, as well a number of other evil beings. <a href="5522.html"><em>Spell Law</em></a> defines 'Evil' as something that causes intentional suffering or destruction and strives to overthrow good. Bad intentions do not count as evil. If an animal is trying to kill the ChanneIer, butis only hungry, it is not evil.</p>
<p>All three of these definitions can be altered to fit the GM's particular view of the concepts, and also to fit well within the world of the campaign.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> An evil creature to Dalinor could be a group of Orcs, a corrupt Paladin, or a Dragon, as well as his "enemies" and all creatures "of darkness".</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/15.3/HOLY ITEMS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_15.3">15.3</a> HOLY ITEMS</h2>
<p>Holy items include such things as holy swords, armor, rods, staves, vestments, chalices, arks, scrolls, etc. How these items are created and what their purpose is will vary from game to game and from world to world. Many <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic items can be created by <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Channeling_Alchemist">Channeling Alchemists</a> (see the <a href="5601.html"><em>Treasure Companion</em></a>), either through their normally acquired spells, or by way of special, more powerful spells channeled to them from their deity. Alternately, a deity may have actually created a powerful <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> item himself. This section will explain different types of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic items and how their connection to the realm of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> makes them unique.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.3.0.0.1">15.3.0.0.1</a> Types of Holy Items</h5>
<p>A distinction should be made between those items that have been made simply by the power of a deity, those that have been imbued with the will of the deity, and those that channel power directly from a deity.</p>
<p>The weapons or items that any character can use are those that have simply been made by the power of a deity. Any <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist">Mentalist</a> can pick up these weapons and use them without a problem. They radiate <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic, but retain no active connection to the deity whose power made the item. The power of the deity was used to make the item, and the item's power exists independently after that.</p>
<p>Some weapons are made so as to retain the will of their deity in them. These items retain a connection to the deity whose power created it. These items will try to prevent certain people from using them. This type of item will normally be intelligent, and will initiate a Will Contest against anyone who it believes is not worthy to wield it. If the item is of a more generic nature (e.g., "Good" or "Evil"), the "General Alignment Reactor" is recommended. If the item is more religion specific in nature, then the "Critical Alignment Reactor" is recommended. The rules for Will Contests are presented here for your convenience. Be careful to note the differences in determining a character's and an item's will.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.3.0.0.2">15.3.0.0.2</a> Will for Characters</h5>
<p>A character's will is determined by his five "will" stats (or more accurately, the stat bonuses for his will stats). The five will states are: Reasoning, Self Discipline, Empathy, Intuition, and Presence. Add together the stat bonuses for these five stats and then multiply by three. This is the character's will bonus. This bonus will add to all Will Contests.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.3.0.0.3">15.3.0.0.3</a> Will for Items</h5>
<p>To determine the will for items, you must first derive the item's will stats. Before using the table below, the GM must assign an intelligence level for the item (Empathic, Low Intelligence, Medium Intelligence, High Intelligence, Very High Intelligence, Artifact, or Legendary Artifact). If an intelligence level is not obvious, simply use Medium Intelligence. Roll d100 (open-ended) on the chart below (using the appropriate column for item's intelligence level). Roll once for each ofthe five will stats. Add the five results together (do not triple) to determine the item's will.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.3.0.0.4">15.3.0.0.4</a> Will Contests</h5>
<p>An item does not always communicate its will or direction in a clearly discernible form (e.g., by voice or telepathic contact). Instead, an item sometimes reveals its direction in the way in which it can slowly but dramatically alter the persona of the individual wielding the item. This assumes that the item is able to gain control of the individual, and that the intents of the item are different from those of the person.</p>
<p>Before a Will Contest can be resolved, a "control situation" must exist. A control situation is defined as anytime a character is touching an item and attempts to use the item in a way that is contrary to its purpose and/or alignment (sometimes this is simply wielding the item).</p>
<p>Whenever a control situation arises, a special RR should be made. Use the item's level as the attack level and the character's level as the target level. However, the only other modifiers to this roll are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The target character's racial modifier (see chart below).</p></li>
<li><p>Any modifiers that result from previous Will Contests.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="CC_15.3.0.0.5">15.3.0.0.5</a> True Channeling Magic Items</h5>
<p>The last type of item is called a <span id="channeling">True Channeling</span> magic item. This kind of item has power in itself to create effects drawing on the power of a deity and the character. Spell lists have been included in this companion to simulate one way to do this. The caster is required to exert power points, and the holy item allows the caster to use the spells from that list through the holy item.</p>
<p>Other types of <span id="channeling">True Channeling</span> magic items could be created by the Gamemaster, giving various types ofpowers and abilities to the user. The item is actually channeling power from a deity (just like a character) and is using this channeled power to shape the character's power points into effects. This type of holy item will do absolutely no good to anyone that is not a worshipper of the deity that the item is made for, and would very likely initiate a Will Contest with anyone unworthy who attempts to pick it up.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.3.0.0.6">15.3.0.0.6</a> Effects of Holy Items</h5>
<p>Holy items of all types normally will have abilities that reflect the Sphere of Influence of the deity whose power created it, in addition to common bonuses given to items (e.g., bonuses to OB, DB, etc.). What these special abilities are and how they are manifested will be left to the individual GM's discretion. Some suggestions for holy items might include:</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.3.0.0.7">15.3.0.0.7</a> Powerful Relics</h5>
<p>Relics are items created by either an extremely powerful deity or some other, equally powerful force. These items are invariably quite old, sometimes dating back to the "creation" ofa world, plane, or universe. On occasion, such an item may even be sentient and have an intelligence of its own apart from the deity that created it. In the hands of a mortal, relics are generally ineffective, as they cannot fully bring their power to bear. These items are often powerful enough to instantly dominate the wielder's mind or even kill them due the high amount of power imbedded in the item. Their power is usually beyond mortal ability, though this does not stop mortals from questing after them.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_15.3.0.0.8">15.3.0.0.8</a> Written Channeling Magic</h5>
<p>Although <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic is primarily available through channeling power from a deity, there are some forms of written <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic. First, runes are not uncommon, but will tend not to have very powerful spells on them. Runes normally hold healing, protection, detection, and other spells usable by most <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> characters (those found on the open and closed <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> lists). In these cases, the source of power to cast the spell is stored in the magic of the written word, and released upon reading. <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> runes are often created by priests of a religion to be given to a person with limited or no power points, to perform things such as healing in a distant village or other such services for the church.</p>
<p>There are always exceptions, and in major temples or religious libraries there may be some more powerful writings containing high-level spells, but characters would be hard pressed to lay hands on them even if they are trusted members of the church. There may also be some works and tomes of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic buried deep within the vaults of an ancient temple. These tomes could contain ancient rituals, ceremonial writings, or the works of a lost religion. These more powerful forms of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> magic normally require the active cooperation of the deity to work; though some do not.</p>

<h2><a name="CC_15.4">15.4</a> HOLY SITES</h2>
<p>A site becomes holy when a deity imparts a portion of its power to a place that has become very important to that deity's religion. The cause of this importance can originate many ways. The first might be a supernatural or spectacular event that was caused by divine power (e.g., a place where a divine being has visited). The second might be sites made holy by mortals, for the express purpose of worshiping or contacting their deity better. In this case, the worshiper has usually used a spell to make the site holy, and the deity has agreed. In any case the GM should carefully consider the effects of holy sites in his world.</p>
<p>The powers and effects of such a holy site are as different as the religion of the deity that they are dedicated to. Worshipers of the deity of the site are much more likely to gain more benefits than non-worshipers from any of the site's powers. Members of the religion may merely be considered to be under the effects of "Bless" or "Protection" spells of various magnitudes when near a holy site. Other, more powerful sites could potentially give the religion's worshipers more power to draw on, thereby increasing the amount of power points available to them. They may receive bonuses to RRs or their spells may be treated as a higher level when someone is attempting to resist them. A temple dedicated to a healing deity could possibly increase the healing rates of all those within it, while a temple dedicated to death would keep people from healing naturally.</p>
<p>The power of holy sites can vary with the distance that a worshiper is from it if the GM wishes. This means that a holy site to a deity of magic might grant that religion's worshipers increasing bonuses to spell casting in relation to how close they are to the site. A site dedicated to an evil deity might start off by sending chills down a person's spine. As they get closer, they would get a feeling ofterror; and as they get even closer, eventually result in the character making a fear RR just to remain in the area.</p>
<p>Holy sites will also likely have guards and wards against spells cast by those not of the religion. More powerful sites could even cause damage to those not of the faith or to those who are enemies of the faith. They might even repel members of other or opposite religions. A church or temple to the deity of life could have the effect of a permanent Repel Undead spell on it. A pyramid dedicated to a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Fire</a> might repel Ice Elementals, etc.</p>
<p>A holy site can take many forms, from a clearing in a forest, to a temple, to a graveyard. Normally, most churches are considered to be holy ground for the religion, but they mayor may not hold the importance of being a holy site. Temples and other such clearly religious structures will almost always qualify as holy sites.</p>
<p>For more information on protection of holy sites and possible effects of holy sites and altars, see the <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#CR_33.9">Sacred Grounds</a> spell list in the <a href="5542.html"><em>Castles and Ruins</em></a> sourcebook. The benefits from holy sites can take many and varied forms. Gamemasters are encouraged to make the effects reflect the Sphere of Influence of the deity to whom the site is dedicated.</p>

<blockquote><p>The town meeting was convened the moment it was known that the anny was on its way. Priests from various religions were in attendance, the town grateful for each oftheir help. A Priest ofthe church of Azayan was here, his robe and amulet depicting symbols ofjustice. A Priest ofLondarin was here as well, quiet and somber. The powerful warriors of thatfaith would be needed in the coming struggle. A Priestess of Lessara had made a great journey and sacrifice to get here. As afollower ofa nature deity, she would lend her wisdom o fthe lands surrounding the city to the council. Finally, a Priest from the Temple of Eternal Night was here as well, his deep blue robes flowing as he walked. No one knew his exact reasons for being at this meeting, but he was welcomed. The general beheld this array of vastly different abilities andpowers, and considered how it could be best used to defeat their common enemy...</p></blockquote>
<p>If the Gamemaster wants further specialization among his priests, this section provides another set of templates to use in creating specialty priests. However, the Gamemaster should be careful as this method requires a significant amount of moderation on his part (to ensure that the speciality priest does not overpower other professions).</p>
<p>This section is highly geared toward Gamemaster and player interaction during character creation. The following section wiII use the phrases like the GM will do "this and that," but in reality, the GM and player can work together on creating a new <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a>, though the GM's word is always final on any subject.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/16.1/SELECTING THE TEMPLATE" -->
<h2><a name="CC_16.1">16.1</a> SELECTING THE TEMPLATE</h2>
<p>When creating a new <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Specialty Priest</a>, the first thing that a GM and player will want to do is choose one of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> profession templates to use as a starting point. Which of these templates the character will use is going to depend on what kind of <a href="../en.lrpj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> is to be created.</p>
<p>Select a template which best suits the religion of the character. A <a href="../en.proj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Combat</a> or Warfare may be a pure arms user similar to a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a>; a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Guardianship</a> may be a semi-spell user similar to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin</a>; a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Death</a> or Destruction may be a hybrid-spell user similar to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</a>; and lastly a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Nature</a> or the Forest may be a pure spell user similar to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Animist">Animist</a>. By identifying the nature of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> to be created a template can be chosen which best represents his purpose.</p>
<p>If the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> is to be a pure spell user, use the rules as presented in <a href="#CC_9.0">Section 9.0</a>. Note that the <a href="../en.lproj/trainingpackages.html">Training Package</a> costs are all calculated using the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> as presented in <a href="#CC_9.0">Section 9.0</a>. If the Gamemaser decides to use any of the templates in this section, he will probably want to adjust the costs of some training packages (to reflect the slightly different skill costs for the templates presented in this section).</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5604/16.2/SELECTING BASE LISTS" -->
<h2><a name="CC_16.2">16.2</a> SELECTING BASE LISTS</h2>
<p>The next step in creating a new <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> profession is to select what spell lists that the character will have access to as base lists. The Gamemaster will have the final word on what combination of base lists would be appropriate for the profession. The GM should keep in mind the effects on game balance that certain combinations of lists will have. The original <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric</a> profession had only two or three lists that were very powerful. If you allow your players to take all of the most powerful lists, then there will likely be a game balance concern. The new Priest lists are not allowed as any of the four extra base lists that pure spell users may select.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there are some ofthe original <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric's</a> lists that would be good for almost any <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a>, like the <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_2.4.2">Communal Ways</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_2.4.4">Protections</a> lists. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin's</a> <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_2.5.1">Communion</a> could also be used this way.</p>
<p>The next item you may wish to change are the profession bonuses. The GM may redistribute the fifty profession bonus points to reflect the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priests</a> purposes. For example, a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of War</a> or a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Crusader">Crusader</a> may get an added bonus in the Weapon group, while a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of Defense</a> would likely get a bonus to his Armor group.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_16.2.0.0.1">16.2.0.0.1</a> Other Channeling Spell Lists</h5>
<p>The list of possible <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> base lists is larger than only those included in this book. Possible base lists for <a href="../en.lrpoj/professions.html#Priest">Priests</a> include all the <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> base lists in <a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a>. It also includes any other <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> base lists from any book that could apply to a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> profession, such as <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html">Holy Wards</a> from <a href="5601.html"><em>Treasure Companion</em></a> and <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#CR_33.9">Sacred Grounds</a> from <a href="5542.html"><em>Castles & Ruins</em></a>, as well as <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> base lists in future Rolemaster products.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_16.2.0.0.2">16.2.0.0.2</a> Other Realm Spell Lists</h5>
<p>There may be an instance where you want to use a list from another realm as a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> base list. For example, a deity of thievery may give his worshipers access to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Dabbler">Dabbler's</a> <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.5.6">Thieving Law</a>, or a deity may have illusion as its Sphere of Influence, and give some of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Illusionist">Illusionist</a> base lists to his followers.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, the GM will be the final arbitrator as to what lists that Channelers can gain access to. These lists are then treated in all ways as <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell lists. GMs should take a close look at any lists that are not <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>, and check them for game balance problems before using them as <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> lists in his game.</p>
<p>If a list in question is too powerful, then many options could be chosen to tone the list down. One, all spells on the list could be two or three levels higher than normal. Two, the list could be made to cost extra development points (e.g., 4/4/4, or 5/5/5 for a pure or hybrid spell user, and 7/7/7 or 8/8/8 for a semi spell user). Three, some limiting factor or flaw can be attached to the list, such as each spell on the list causing the caster to take as many hits as the level of the spell. Various other options could be invented.</p>
<p>When including other realm spell lists with a priest, you may have to decide whether or not to give <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spell users powers that they normally do not have. There are three notable abilities that the realm of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> does not have: <em>Flying</em>, <em>Haste</em>, and <em>Invisibility</em>, though there are others. There may come a time where you have a deity of wind, speed, or stealth, and you may want to provide your priests with these types of spells.</p>
<p>It is the recommendation of the authors, that if a GM finds that he wants to give his <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> characters access to lists of this nature, that they make doubly sure that the created <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> is well balanced. There is no conceptual reason that Channelers cannot cast these types of spells, especially if their deity's Sphere of Influence calls for it.</p>

<p>A set of profession bonuses will need to be selected at this point. These bonuses should, as always, reflect the nature of the Priest.

These skills should reflect what type of <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> the character is playing. Use caution when choosing them. Everyman and Occupational skills can greatly affect game balance. In the above <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest of War</a> example, the GM may want to assign <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Tactics">Tactics</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Military_Organization">Military Organization</a> as Everyman skills. Likewise, the GM should determine appropriate Restricted skills.

<p>A Necromancer is a Priest dedicated to the raising of the dead and the destruction of the living. He is armed with all manner of evil power, including darkness, disease, aging, and necromancy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dazzoreth surveyed the famous city of Eldrania. With most of the troops off fighting the war with their neighbors, taking the town should be easy. He nodded to his wraith servant, the signal to begin the attack. Skeletons, Zombies, and Wights all poured from the hillside as nightfell across the land. As long as the Priests were away with the army, the town would be his. He smiled and joined the attack.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a name="CC_17.0">17.0</a> PROFESSION BASE LISTS</h1>
<p>This section lists all of the spells associated with the <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> realm. All of the standard rules, restrictions, and notations from <a href="5522.html"><em>Spell Law</em></a> are used here. For convenience, the spell description key is repeated here.</p>
<h4><a name="CC_17.0.0.1">17.0.0.1</a> THE SPELL DESCRIPTION KEY</h4>
<p>Several types ofcodes may follow the spell names in the listings: area of effect, duration, range, and type. In addition, some descriptions will explain that a particular spell has an RR Modification (shown with the notation [RR Mod: #]). This section presents a key to those codes.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_17.0.0.1.1">17.0.0.1.1</a> Special Spell Codes</h5>
<p><strong><tt>[RR Mod #]</tt></strong> &mdash; Any RRs against the effects ofthis spell are modified by #.</p>
<p><strong>&#42;</strong> &mdash; Instantaneous; spell does not require preparation rounds.</p>
<p><strong>&bull;</strong> &mdash; Spell does not require power points.</p>
<p><strong>&Dagger;</strong> &mdash; Part of a set of spells that must be thrown in conjunction with other spells continuously to be effective (or fully effective).</p>
<h5><a name="CC_17.0.0.1.2">17.0.0.1.2</a> Spell Types</h5>
<p><strong>E</strong> &mdash; Elemental spell. These spells use the force ofthe spell to manipulate physical elements (heat, cold, wind, light, water, earth, sound, smell, taste, touch). These elements (and not the spell) are used to either create a phenomena that can affect the physical environment of the target (e.g., a "wall" spell) or the sense of the target (e.g., an "illusion" spell). Because the elements are real, no Resistance Rolls are normally allowed.</p>
<p><strong>BE</strong> &mdash; Ball Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that attack an area with one of the physical elements.</p>
<p><strong>DE</strong> &mdash; Directed Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that directly attack a target with one of the physical elements. Such attacks are resolved on one of the "bolt" attack tables.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> &mdash; Force spell. These spells involve the direct manipulation of matter, energy, the elements, or living beings through the use of a spell's force. If the spell has a target capable of resisting, the caster makes an attack roll on the <em>Spell Law</em> <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.1">Basic Spell Attack Table 5.1</a> to determine the RR modification for the target. Determine the type of armor the target is wearing and roll on the appropriate column of the table (using the Other column if nothing else applies). After determining the RR modification, the target makes an RR (on <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.10">Table 5.10</a> in <em>Spell Law</em>, using the target's level and the attacker's level as the indices).</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> &mdash; Passive spell. These spells usually only indirectly or passively affect a target. Thus, if an RR is allowed (GM' s discretion), its purpose is only to determine if the target is aware of the spell. Many detection speIls are of this type.</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> &mdash; Utility spell. These spells only affect the caster, a willing target, or a target incapable of resistance. Thus, RRs are not usually necessary. A willing target who is capable of resisting may still be required to make an RR (GM's discretion), but it is modified by -50 (i.e., he mostly likely will not resist successfuIly). Most healing spells are of this type.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> &mdash; Informational spell. These spells involve gathering information through means that do not require RRs.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_17.0.0.1.3">17.0.0.1.3</a> Spell Sub-Types</h5>
<p><strong>s</strong> &mdash; Subconscious spell. These spells are capable of being cast (or triggered) by the subconscious. The caster can always cast a spell of this type as a normal spell; and ifhe is unconscious (or is asleep or in a trance), a spell of this type can be cast by the subconscious as necessary (starting with the highest level spell needed). An exception to this is the Stun RelieJspel1. This spell may (at the option ofthe caster) be cast by the subconscious while the caster is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong> &mdash; Mental Attack spell. These spells affect the target's mind and are subject to mental defenses.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_17.0.0.1.4">17.0.0.1.4</a> Spell Areas of Effect</h5>
<p><strong><em>x</em> target(s)</strong> &mdash; The spell affects <em>x</em> number of targets.</p>
<p><strong><em>x</em> target(s)/lvl</strong> &mdash; The speIl affects a number of targets equal to the caster's level times <em>x</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em> R</strong> &mdash; The spell affects all within a radius equal to <em>distance</em> in size.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em> R/lvl</strong> &mdash; The spell affects all within a radius equal to <em>distance</em> times the caster's level in size.</p>
<p><strong><em>area</em></strong> &mdash; The spell affects all within a fixed area of effect. Sometimes <em>area</em> will be specified as a specific target (e.g., 1 herb, 1 limb, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>caster</strong> &mdash; The spell affects only the caster.</p>
<p><strong>"&mdash;"</strong> &mdash; The spell has no area of effect.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> &mdash; The exact size of the area of effect depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<h5><a name="CC_17.0.0.1.5">17.0.0.1.5</a> Spell Durations</h5>
<p><strong><em>time</em></strong> &mdash; The spell has a fixed duration equal to time.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> &mdash; Concentration is required. Concentration takes 50% of the caster's normal activity. The caster cannot cast any other spells while concentrating.</p>
<p><strong><em>duration</em> (C)</strong> &mdash; Concentration is required, except the period of concentration cannot exceed the <em>duration</em> given. The caster can stop concentrating and the spell effect will stop. If the duration has not expired, the caster can concentrate again and the spell effect will resume.</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> &mdash; Permanent. The spell has a permanent effect (in the sense of creating a "permanent" physical or mental condition). The effects of permanent spells that manipulate matter <strong>and</strong> require concentration will disperse according to the normal physical laws once concentration is no longer applied (e.g., a frozen body of water will melt normaIly, a bowl of boiling water will cool). A spell with a permanent duration may be affected by outside forces.</p>
<p>For example, the spell may be dispelled, cured, <strong>or</strong> otherwise disturbed by enchantment, physical force, etc.</p><p><strong>varies</strong> &mdash; Variable. The exact duration depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>"&mdash;"</strong> &mdash; No duration. The effects of this spell required no duration and are applied immediately.</p>
<p><strong><em>time</em> / level</strong> &mdash; The duration is the <em>time</em> multiplied by the level of the caster.</p>
<p><strong><em>time</em> / <em>#</em> fail</strong> &mdash; The duration is based upon the difference between the target's modified RR and the minimum roll required to resist the spell (see <em>RMSR</em> <a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.6">Section 23.6</a>). The duration is equal to this difference divided by <em>#</em> and then multiplied by <em>time</em>.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> 1 rnd/10 fail would mean that ifthe RR is failed by 20, the spell would lastfor 2 rounds.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="CC_17.0.0.1.6">17.0.0.1.6</a> Spell Ranges</h5>
<p><strong>self</strong> &mdash; The spell can only be cast upon the caster himself.</p>
<p><strong>touch</strong> &mdash; The caster must touch the target to create the effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em></strong> &mdash; The caster can be no further than <em>distance</em> to the desired area of effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em>/lvl</strong> &mdash; The distance to the area of effect can be no further than <em>distance</em> times the caster's level.</p>
<p><strong>unlimited</strong> &mdash; There are no limitations placed upon the distance to the area of effect.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> &mdash; The distance to the area of effect depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<h4><a name="CC_17.0.0.2">17.0.0.2</a> WHAT'S ON A SPELL LIST</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Spell List Name</strong>&mdash;The name of the spell list appears in two places on the page; above the descriptions and above the listing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spell List Number</strong>&mdash;Each spell list is given a unique identifier that combines its classification and the equivalent of a section number.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Listing</strong>&mdash;In one of the upper comers of the page is a listing of all the spells on the list, sorted by level. This listing also shows important spell parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check Box</strong>&mdash;Beside each spell in the listing is a check box. Use this box to indicate the level two which your character currently knows spells on the list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spell Level/Name</strong>&mdash;The level and name of each spell appears in two places on the page; in the listing and in the descriptions. In all cases, if the name of two spells are the same (except for perhaps a roman numeral), the spells should be treated as the same.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Area of Effect</strong>&mdash;This is the area affected by the spell. If "varies" appears here, check the description for the exact area of effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Duration</strong>&mdash;This is the duration that the spell will remain active. If "varies" appears here, check the description for the exact duration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Range</strong>&mdash;This is the range from the caster to the area of effect. If "varies" appears here. check the description for the exact range.</p></li>

<h1><a name="CC_18.0">18.0</a> CRITICAL &amp; FAILURE</h1>
<h4><a name="CC_18.0.0.1">18.0.0.1</a> INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>This section contains this introduction, a key to all ofthe tables in this section, 5 critical tables, and I failure table. In addition, at the bottom ofeach table there is a key for all of the special symbols used in the table.</p>
<h4><a name="CC_18.0.0.2">18.0.0.2</a> HOW TO USE THESE TABLES</h4>
<p>To resolve most critical hits, roll d100 (not open-ended) and cross-index the result on the appropriate column of the chart.</p>
<p>The exception to this method are the large and superlarge critical tables. When attacking a target that is classified as "large" or "super large," you must ascertain whether the attack deals normal damage or slaying damage. Cross-index a high open-ended d100 roll with the type ofdamage dealt.</p>
<p>To resolve a failure, simply roll a d 100 (not open-ended) and cross-index the result with the type of spell attack that generated the failure. Each column on the table corresponds to a type (or types) of spells. Use the column that corresponds to the type of spell being cast.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Mool Kylor is in the middle ofa combat with a black bear. He attacks with a Fire Bolt spell (using the Fire Bolt attack table).<br>
During the first round of combat, Maal rolls a 02, a fumble! He rolls again, resulting in a 49. He looks up a 49 on the Elemental column and sees that he loses the spell and the power points.</blockquote>
<h4><a name="CC_18.0.0.3">18.0.0.3</a> SLAYING ATTACKS</h4>
<p>Certain types of spell attacks may be deemed as "slaying" against specific types of creatures. For example, a Vacuum spelI cast upon an elemental creature of air, is treated as slaying. If you are using a "slaying" attack against a target that is not large or super large, you should resolve the attack normally. However, if the normal attack delivers a critical, the weapon will deliver an additional slaying critical. Cross-index the roll used to resolve the normal critical on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#CC_T-6.5">Slaying column of the Creature Critical Strike Table 6.5</a>.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Mike, playing Kohrist the Magician, casts a Vacuum Ion an Elemental Servant. The description o fthe spell reads that anyone in the area of effect suffers an 'A' Impact critical.<br>
His normal critical roll is a 96! He resolves the normal critical and then he rolls again (because 96 is open-ended), getting an 11; for a total of 107. He looks up 107 on the Slaying column of the Large Creature Critical Strike Table 6.5.</blockquote>
<h4><a name="18.0.0.4">18.0.0.4</a> KEYS TO THE TABLES</h4>
<p>All of the tables in this section have two different types of information: descriptions and mechanics.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The description information will describe the critical hit (usually including a body location). The GM should feel free to alter the description to more appropriately fit the type of attack.</p></li>
<li><p>The mechanics information is the game effects of the critical hit. The GM should rarely alter these results. The presentation of this information will always follow this format:</p></li>
</ul>
<code>+&szlig;H-   - &szlig;®- &szlig;'-&szlig;(-a)- &szlig;(+a)</code>
<p>where a and &szlig; are numbers. In general:</p>
<p>H = hits</p><p>  = rounds of stun</p><p>® = rounds of no parry</p><p>X = rounds of must parry</p>
<p>&bull; = hits per round</p><p>(-a) = penalty</p><p>(+a) =bonus</p>
<p>Sometimes, the second and third items are combined (reading as     ). Also, sometimes the third item is replaced with &szlig;(X-a) (there can never be both a ® and a X entry). Below is a more detailed explanation of the entries.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>+&szlig;H &mdash; This indicates that the target of the attack takes an additional &szlig; hits of damage.</p></li>
<li><p>   &mdash; This indicates that the target of the attack is stunned for &szlig; rounds. While stunned, the target may only parry with half of his normal ability; the only other allowed actions are maneuvering (modified by at least -50). When Bis not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</p></li>
<li><p>&szlig;®: This indicates that the target of the attack cannot parry for &szlig; rounds. The only allowable actions are manuevering (modified by at least -75). This result is often accompanied by a   result (see above). When &szlig; is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</p></li>
<li><p>&szlig;(X-a): This indicates that the target of the attack must parry for his next &szlig; actions with a penalty of a. When &szlig; is not specified, it is assumed to be 1. When a is not specified, it is assumed to be zero.</p></li>
<li><p>&szlig;': This indicates that the target of the attack will loose &szlig; hits every round until the wound is healed. "Bleeding" represents not only actual blood loss, but also represents ongoing pain. When &szlig; is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</p></li>
<li><p>&szlig;(-a): This indicates the target of the attack suffers a penalty of a for &szlig; rounds. When &szlig; is not specified, the penalty is assumed to last until the wound is healed.</p></li>
<li><p>&szlig;(+a): This indicates that the attacker gains a bonus of a for &szlig; rounds. When &szlig; is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</p></li>
<li><p>&szlig;f} This indicates that the defender gains &szlig; corruption points. When &szlig; is not specified, it is assumed to be a 1.</p></li>

<h2><a name="EC_12.1">12.1</a> RUNEMAGE</h2>
<p>Runemages are Hybrid spell users of <span id="essence">Essence</span> and <span id="channeling">Channelling</span> who concentrate on the power written and spoken language have over the reality. Generally, all Runemages are Nomenist spell casters, though they rarely choose the Training Package for Nomenist Casters. The Runemages have their own base list, which is more refined than the standard Nomenist Caster spell list. Runemages use their power of language to create variable enchantments such as wards, symbols, and runes, while using their knowledge of the Primal Tongue to manipulate the physical world and the creatures within it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jerickson finished inscribing the last power runes to complete his circle. Standing he surveyed the work of several hours of scratching on the solid stone floor. Beautiful. Right now they were nothing but a series of thin almost invisible lines and symbols. Surely they would be overlooked once the room was full of food, merriment and guests. Jerickson smiled. His foe would be in that crowd and he'd never know what hit him. The rest of the crowd would be safe&mdash;so long as they stepped away from Llewdlac when his body erupted in flames. Only someone with the right skill looking in the right place would ever notice the hidden words and signs.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prime Stats:</strong> Empathy and Intuition</p>

<h2><a name="EC_12.2">12.2</a> MANA MOLDER</h2>
<p>Mana Molders are Pure spell users of <span id="essence">Essence</span> who concentrate on Mana Fonns. Mana Forms are solid manifestations of the <span id="essence">Essence</span>. Mana Molders employ their spells to create temporary items, force fields, and even mana creatures. Mana creatures can either be servants capable of simple tasks or warriors capable of following simple orders.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rhojhex watched grimly as the last of his Mana Warriors fell to the stout clubs of the Troglodytes. Now only a thin field of solidified Essence stood between him and the flesh-hungry monsters, and it would only take afew moments for them to hammer throughit. He eyed the twenty foot chasm behind him and a thought began to form. One of his other forms might just bridge the gap. Rhojhex the Mana Molder had a couple of tricks left yet.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prime Stats:</strong> Empathy and Agility</p>
