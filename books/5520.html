<h1><a name="AL_1"></a><a name="AL_1.0">1.0</a> Welcome</h1>
<p><em>Arms Law (AL)</em> deals with the integration of armed and unarmed combat into a fantasy role playing environment. It is designed to be used as the combat system for <strong><em>Rolemaster (RM)</em></strong> or as the combat system for other FRP games. In the latter case, it can be used as a whole or in part. <em>Arms Law</em> can add flavor, realism, and depth to your campaign without sacrificing playability.<br />
<em>Arms Law</em> has been designed to provide a logical, detailed, manageable procedure for resolving combat between individuals and small groups. Although this system may be unwieldy for melees involving more than 30 combatants, the guidelines can easilty be simplified for such situations.<br />
<em>Arms Law</em> can be implemented as a stand-alone combat system for use with any FRP. However, it is one of the four cornerstones of the <strong><em>Rolemaster Standard System</em></strong>, along with <em><a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a>, <a href="5521.html">GM Law</a>,</em> and the <em><a href="5500.html">Rolemaster Standard Rules</a></em>. <em>Arms Law</em> provides the combat tables and charts for the system, and the <em>Rolemaster Standard Rules</em> fully describes their use within the system. Those players and gamemasters who are already familiar with <em>Arms Law</em> (from previous editions of <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong>) can use this book without any modification to the old system (though you may want to check out the new weapon breakage rules—see the appendices). For players and gamemasters who are using <em>Arms Law</em> without <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong>, you will need to familiarize yourself with the material in the appendices before just diving in.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<p>Here is a list of some of the key features of <em>Arms Law</em>.
<ul>
<li>A fantasy medieval melee and missile combat system with individual attack tables for twenty-nine weapons and statistics for dozens more.</li>
<li>Thirteen attack tables that integrate the size, instincts, and fighting patterns of a wide variety of animals, monsters, and practitioners of martial arts (and brawling).</li>
<li>Twelve Critical Strike Tables for: slashing, puncturing, crushing, grappling, unbalancing, tiny animal attacks, attacks on large creatures, attacks on super-large creatures, martial arts striking attacks, martial arts sweeping attacks, brawling, and subdual.</li>
<li>Two tables for fumbles and a table for moving manuevers.</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>New from Previous Editions?</h3>
<p>Here is a list of some of the major changes from previous editions of <em>AL &amp; CL</em>.
<ul>
<li>The Armored Fist Attack Table has been removed and the Brawling Attack Table has been added.</li>
<li>The Brawling Critical Strike Table, Subdual Critical Strike Table, and the Non-Weapon Fumble Table have been added.</li>
<li>Critical strike tables have been reformatted for ease of use (system specific information is found at the bottom of each critical description) and more “color” text has been added.</li>
<li>Attack tables have been printed on a page with the appropriate critical strike table(s) on the back. Each table can now be used almost without reference to the rest of Arms Law.</li>
<li>New rules for weapon breakage have been added. For those using <em>Arms Law</em> without the <em>Rolemaster Standard Rules</em>, a summary of the weapon breakage rules can be found in the appendices.</li>
</ul></p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> For readabilty purposes, these rules use standard English grammar when referring to persons of uncertain gender: i.e., masculine pronouns. In such cases, these pronouns are intended to convey the meanings she/he, his/her, etc.

<h1><a name="AL_2"></a><a name="AL_2.0">2.0</a> Weapon Attack Tables</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This section contains this introduction, a key to all of the tables in this section, and 29 weapon attack tables. Each page with an attack table on it will have the most appropriate critical table(s) on the back. In addition, at the top of each table there is other pertinent information for the weapon.</p>
<h3>How to Use These Tables</h3>
<p>To resolve an attack, the attacker must roll a high open-ended attack roll (see page 110 for a description of the different types of rolls). If this attack roll (before modifications) is within the fumble range of the weapon, the attack is a fumble and the attacker must roll again on the appropriate fumble table. Otherwise, apply all modifications to the attack roll and cross-index the result with the defender’ s
armor type.<br />
There are three possible results on the tables: a miss (i.e., “–”), a normal hit (e.g., “3”), or a critical strike (e.g., “5BS”). If the result is a miss, the attack fails. If the result is a normal hit, apply the number in the table as damage to the defender (i.e., subtract the number from the defender’s hits). If the result is a critical strike, apply the number portion of the result against the defender’s hits and roll a second roll on the indicated critical table and column. The first letter indicates the severity of the critical hit (i.e., the column to roll on) and the second letter indicates which critical table to roll on (K=Krush, P=Puncture, S=Slash, U=Unbalancing and G=Grapple).</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If you are not using Rolemaster (RM), you should examine all of the Appendices for notes on how to use these tables effectively.
</blockquote><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Bill is playing Kendric the Bard. Kendric is standing around the bodies of his fallen friends. The only ones that remain standing are the enemy captain and himself. He readies his rapier and attacks.<br />
Bill rolls percentile dice and the result is a 12. Bill knows that the fumble range for a rapier is 01-04, so he didn't fumble his attack. After all modifications, the attack roll results in a 63. Cross-indexing with the captains Armor Type (chain shirt—13) reveals that the attack did 2 concussion points of damage.<br />
The GM now rolls for the captain, resulting in a 79. The captain is using a short sword. The GM checks the fumble range (01-02) on a short sword and realizes the captain does not fumble his weapon. After all modifications, the attack roll is a 141! The GM cross-indexes this result with Kendric's Armor Type (metal breastplate—17) and discovers that poor Kendric takes 10 concussion points of damage and a 'D' Puncture Critical Strike!
</blockquote>
<h3>Key to the Tables</h3>
<p>At the top of each table, there is a box that contains some information. Each piece of information is listed below, along with a description of its purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Weapon Name:</strong> The weapon to which this table applies.</li>
<li><strong>Attack Table Number:</strong> This is a unique number that can be used to identify the table.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon Type:</strong> This is the RM Weapon Category that this weapon uses. In the standard FRP campaign, there are six weapon types: One-Handed Edged, One-Handed Crushing, Missile, Thrown, Two-Handed, Polearm.</li>
<li><strong>Length:</strong> The standard range of lengths for this weapon. It is possible to have a unique weapon of this type that falls outside this range.</li>
<li><strong>Weight:</strong> The standard range of weights for this weapon. It is possible to have a unique weapon of this type that falls outside this range.</li>
<li><strong>Fumble:</strong> This shows the chance that this weapon will fumble in an attack. If an unmodified attack roll falls within the range shown, the attacker fumbles his weapon and must then roll on the appropriate Fumble Table.</li>
<li><strong>Breakage #s:</strong> These numbers show how often the weapon should be checked for breakage. Anytime the attacker rolls doubles of the numbers shown (e.g., 11, 55, 88, etc.), the weapon will check for breakage. For missile weapons, the word “Auto” indicates the need to checkforthemissile’sbreakageeverytimeitisfired.</li>
<li><strong>Strength:</strong> The standard range of strengths for a normal weapon of this type. If the range is followed by a "w," the weapon normally has a wooden shaft. This type of weapon should have it’s Strength lowered by 15 when hitting an “edged” object (e.g., one-handed edged weapons, etc.). Similarly, an "s" indicates a "soft" weapon and it’s Strength should be lowered by 30 when hitting edged objects. It is possible to have a unique weapon of this type that falls outside the range(s). Breakage for the missile weapon itself is handled through the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_4.13">Weapon Fumble Table (4.13)</a>. For missile weapons, the indicated ranges apply to the missile. See <a href="5500.html#RMSR_32.4">RMSR Section 32.4</a> for more details.</li>
<li><strong>Range Modifiers:</strong> This shows the range modifications to OB when the weapon is either thrown or used as a missile weapon. If the weapon cannot use the attack table when thrown, there will be a dash here (“—”).</li>
<li><strong>Concussion Damage:</strong> This is an example of an attack result that does only concussion damage.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Strike:</strong> This is an example of an attack result that delivers a critical strike (in addition to concussion damage).</li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="AL_3"></a><a name="AL_3.0">3.0</a> Special Attack Tables</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This section contains this introduction, a key to all of the tables in this section, and 13 special attack tables. Each page will contain a single attack table. On the back of each table will be one or two critical tables. In addition, at the bottom of each table there is other pertinent information for the special attack (including which critical tables are used with the attack).</p>
<h3>How to Use These Tables</h3>
<p>To resolve an attack, the attacker must roll a high open-ended attack roll. If the attack roll (before modifications) is within the fumble range of the attack, the attacker must roll again on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_4.14">Non-Weapon Fumble Table (4.14)</a>. Otherwise, apply all modifications to the attack roll and cross-index the result with the defender’s armor type.<br />
There are three possible results on the tables: a miss (i.e., “–”), a normal hit (e.g., “3”), or a critical hit (e.g., “5BG”). If the result is a miss, the attack fails. If the result is a simple hit, apply the number in the table as damage to the defender (i.e., subtract the number from the defender’s hits). If the result is a critical hit, apply the number portion of the result against the defender’s hits and roll a second roll on the indicated critical table and column. The first letter indicates the severity of the critical hit (i.e., the column to roll on) and the second letter indicates which critical table to roll on (the key for the critical table codes will be found at the bottom of each table). Sometimes, there is no second letter. If this is the case, the critical chart will be indicated a the bottom of the attack table.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If you are not using <strong><em>Rolemaster (RM)</em></strong>, you should examine all of the Appendices for notes on how to use these tables effectively.
</blockquote>
<h3>Defining The Attack</h3>
<p>These tables cover four different types of special attacks. The animal attacks should be obvious by their names (e.g., beak, claw, bite, etc.). The only definition needed is how large the attack is. See <em><a href="5540.html">Creatures &amp; Monsters</a></em> for guidelines on what size different attacks should be (or see page 133-134 in the Appendix).<br />
The Fall/Crush Attack Table is used anytime a creature attack applies crushing force to a character. This table may also be used to simulate the effects of someone falling a distance or something falling from a distance onto a character.<br />
The Brawling Attack Tableshould be used when a character is involved in a free-form melee (i.e., anyone near him could be an opponent). This table should not be used when the exact nature and quantity of foes are known. The size of the attack is dictated by the size of the object held in the character's hand(s). It is presumed that any items used by characters are temporary at best. For more on Brawling rules, see the <em><a href="5500.html">Rolemaster Standard Rules</a></em>.<br />
The two martial arts attack tables separate the two major types of martial arts attack forms. For more on how to use Martial Arts, see the <em>Rolemaster Standard Rules</em> (or page 131-132 in the appendices).</p>
<h3>Key to the Tables</h3>
<p>All of the tables in this section have four different maximum results. This represents four different “sizes” of attacks (or severities of attacks). Before resolving any attack, the GM should determine the appropriate maximum level.<br />
Some attack tables can generate critical results better than an 'E.' When this occurs, a note at the bottom of the table will direct you on how to handle the critical result.<br />
If two criticals are delivered from the same attack, always roll one number and look up the same number in two different columns on the critical chart(s).</p>

<h1><a name="AL_4"></a><a name="AL_4.0">4.0</a> Critical &amp; Fumble Tables</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This section contains this introduction, a key to all of the tables in this section, 12 critical tables, and 2 fumble tables. In addition, at the bottom of each table there is a key for all of the special symbols used in the table.</p>
<h3>How to Use These Tables</h3>
<p>To resolve most critical hits, roll d100 (not open-ended) and cross-index the result on the appropriate column of the chart.<br />
The exception to this method are the large and super-large critical tables. When attacking a target that is classified as “large” or “super-large,” you must ascertain the type of weapon used in the attack. Cross-index a high open-ended d100 roll with the type of weapon used in the attack.<br />
To resolve a fumble, simply roll a d100 (not open-ended) and cross-index the result with the type of attack that generated the fumble. If you fumble a weapon attack, use the Weapon Fumble Table. All non-weapon attacks use the Non-Weapon Fumble Table.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If you are not using <strong><em>Rolemaster (RM)</em></strong>, you should examine all of the Appendices for notes on how to use these tables effectively.
</blockquote><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Aurum is in the middle of a combat with a black bear. Aurum is using his father's enchanted broadsword (using the Broadsword Attack Table) while the bear has only its claws and teeth (using the Claw Attack Table and the Bite Attack Table).<br />
During the first round of combat, Aurum rolls a 04, a fumble! He rolls again, resulting in a 49. He looks up a 49 on the Weapon Fumble Table (One-Handed Arms column) and sees that he loses the attack and gives himself 1 concussion hit.<br />
The bear attacks and rolls a 02! The GM rolls again, resulting in an 86. He looks up 86 on the Non-Weapon Fumble Table (Animal Attacks column) and sees that the bear has tripped himself up and will be stunned for 2 rounds!
</blockquote>
<h3>Holy Weapons</h3>
<p>If you are using a “holy” weapon against a target that is not large or super-large, you should resolve the attack normally. However, if the normal attack delivers a critical, the weapon will deliver an additional critical. Cross-index the roll used to resolve the normal critical on the Holy Arms column of the Large Creature Critical Strike Table.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Delanie is playing Frostflower who has a quarterstaff that has been made “holy” against Trolls. Unfortunately, she finds herself face-to-face with a truly ugly cave troll.<br />
Her normal attack delivers 14 concussion hits and an 'A' Krush critical. Delanie rolls for her Krush critical and gets a 90! After resolving the normal critical, she also looks up 90 on the Holy Arms column of the Large Creature Critical Strike Table (resulting in the death of the poor troll who had no helm).
</blockquote>
<h3>Slaying Weapons</h3>
<p>If you are using a “slaying” weapon against a target that is not large or super-large, you should resolve the attack normally. However, if the normal attack delivers a critical, the weapon will deliver an additional critical. Cross-index the roll used to resolve the normal critical on the Slaying column of the Large Creature Critical Strike Table.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Richard is playing Grundy who has a spear that has been enchanted to slay griffons. During his latest expedition into the mountains, he finds himself facing just such a beast.<br />
His normal attack delivers 22 concussion hits and an 'E' Puncture critical. Richard rolls for his Puncture critical and gets a 96! After resolving the normal critical, he rolls again (because 96 is open-ended), getting an 11; for a total of 107. He looks up 107 on the Slaying column of the Large Creature Critical Strike Table (severing a major vein in the poor griffon—who will die in 6 rounds).
</blockquote>
<h3>Magic and Mithril Weapons</h3>
<p>Magic and Mithril weapons only do extraordinary damage to Large and Super-Large creatures. Do not roll on the Large and Super-Large critical tables when using these types of weapons against normal opponents.</p>
<h3>Key to the Tables</h3>
<p>All of the tables in this section have two different types of information: descriptions and mechanics.</p>
<ul>
<li>The description information will describe the critical hit (usually including a body location). The GM should feel free to alter the description to more appropriately fit the type of attack.</li>
<li>The mechanics information is the game effects of the critical hit. The GM should rarely alter these results. The presentation of this information will always follow this format:
<code>+ßH–ß∑–ß∏–ß∫ –ß(-α)–ß(+α)</code><br />
where α and ß are numbers. In general:<br />
<code>H = hits<br />
∑= rounds of stun<br />
∏= rounds of no parry<br />
π = rounds of must parry<br />
∫ = hits per round<br />
(-α) = penalty<br />
(+α) = bonus</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, the second and third items are combined (reading as ∑∏). Also, sometimes the third item is replaced with ß(π -α) (there can never be both a ∏ and a π entry). Below is a more detailed explanation of the entries.</p>
<ul>
<li>+ßH — This indicates that the target of the attack takes an additional ß hits of damage.</li>
<li>ß∑— This indicates that the target of the attack is stunned for ß rounds. While stunned, the target may only parry with half of his normal ability; the only other allowed actions are maneuvering (modified by at least -50). When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li>ß∏: This indicates that the target of the attack cannot parry for ß rounds. The only allowable actions are manuevering (modified by at least -75). This result is often accompanied by a ∑result (see above). When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li>ß(π -α): This indicates that the target of the attack must parry for his next ß actions with a penalty of α. When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1. When α is not specified, it is assumed to be zero.</li>
<li>ß∫ : This indicates that the target of the attack will loose ß hits every round until the wound is healed. “Bleeding” represents not only actual blood loss, but also represents ongoing pain. When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li>ß(-α): This indicates the target of the attack suffers a penalty of α for ß rounds. When ß is not specified, the penalty is assumed to last until the wound is healed.</li>
<li>ß(+α): This indicates that the attacker gains a bonus of α for ß rounds. When ß is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="AL_5"></a><a name="AL_5.0">5.0</a> Appendices — How to use Arms Law without Rolemaster</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This section presents a set of guidelines for using <em>Arms Law</em> if you do not have access to the full <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong> system. Certain rules have been simplified or changed to make it easier to use for those unfamilar with <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong>.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.1/DICE ROLLING CONVENTIONS" -->
<h2><a name="AL_5.1">5.1</a> DICE ROLLING CONVENTIONS</h2>
<p>Each die used in <em>Arms Law (AL)</em> is a 10-sided die which gives a result between 0 and 9. If two of these dice are used, a variety of results can be obtained. However, results between 1 and 100 are the primary basis of the <em>AL</em> system (i.e., <strong><em>Rolemaster (RM)</em></strong> is a “percentile” system).</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Dice can be obtained at your local game stores. 
</blockquote>
<h4>Percentile (“1-100”) Rolls</h4>
<dd><strong>1-100 Roll</strong> — Most of the rolls in RM are “1-100” rolls (also called “d100” rolls). To obtain a 1-100 result roll two dice together—one die is treated as the “tens” die and the other as the “ones” die (designate before rolling, please). Thus a random result between 01 and 100 (a “00” is treated as 100) is obtained.
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The GM asks a player to make a 1-100 roll. The two dice are rolled; the tens die is a “4” and the ones die is a “7.” Thus the result is “47.”
</blockquote></dd>
<dd><strong>Low Open-ended Roll</strong> — To obtain a “low open-ended roll,” first make a 1-100 roll. A roll of 01-05 indicates a particularly unfortunate occurrence for the roller. The dice are rolled again and the result is subtracted from the first roll. If the second roll is 96-00, a third roll is made and subtracted, and so on until a non-“96-00” roll is made. The total sum of these rolls is the result of the low open-ended roll.
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The GM asks a player to make a low open-ended roll, and the initial roll is a 04 . A second roll is made with a result of 97; so a third roll is made, resulting in a 03. Thus, the low open-ended roll that the GM requested is -96 (= 04 - 97 - 03).
</blockquote></dd>
<dd><strong>High Open-ended Roll</strong> — To obtain a “high open-ended roll” first make a 1-100 roll. A roll of 96-00 indicates a particularly fortunate occurrence for the roller. The dice are rolled again and the result is added to the first roll. If the second roll is 96-00, then a third roll is made and added, and so on until a non 96-00 roll is made. The total sum of these rolls is the result of the high open-ended roll.
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The GM asks a player to make a high open-ended roll, and the initial roll is a 99. A second roll is made with a result of 96; so a third roll is made with a result 04. Thus, the high open-ended roll that the GM requested is 199 (= 99 + 96 + 04).
</blockquote></dd>
<dd><strong>Open-ended Roll</strong> — An open-ended roll is both high open-ended and low open-ended.</dd>
<h4>Non-“1-100” Rolls</h4>
<dd><strong>1-10 Roll</strong> — In instances when a result (roll) between 1 and 10 is required, only one die is rolled. This gives a result between 0 and 9, but the 0 is treated as a 10. Such a roll is referred to as “1- 10” or “d10.”</dd>
<dd><strong>1-5 Roll</strong> — Roll one die, divide by 2 and round up (“1d5”).</dd>
<dd><strong>1-8 Roll</strong> — Roll one die; if the result is 9 or 10, reroll until a 1 to 8 result occurs (“d8”).</dd>
<dd><strong>2-10 Roll</strong> — Roll two dice, divide each result by 2 (round up), and then add the two results to obtain the “2-10” (“2d5”) result. Other Required Rolls — Other rolls are variants of the above.</dd>
<h4>Unmodified Rolls (UM)</h4>
<p>Certain results on some rolls indicate an immediate effect and no modifications are considered. These rolls are marked on the appropriate charts with a UM. For example, all weapon attacks result in a fumble if the initial unmodified attack roll falls within
the fumble range of the weapon.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.2/DEFINITIONS" -->
<h2><a name="AL_5.2">5.2</a> DEFINITIONS</h2>
<p>Listed below are some common terms used in <em>Arms Law (AL)</em> and in <strong><em>Rolemaster (RM)</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> An action is an activity which a character may perform during a round (10 seconds).</p>
<p><strong>Attack Roll:</strong> A “Roll” that is used to determine the results of a melee or missile attack.</p>
<p><strong>Chance:</strong> Often in <em>AL</em> an action or activity has a “chance” of succeeding or occurring, and this chance is usually given in the form of # %. This means that if a roll (1-100) is made (see below) and the result is less than or equal to the #, then the action or activity succeeds (or occurs); otherwise it fails. Alternatively, you can roll (1-100) and add the result to the #; if the result is greater than 100, then the action or activity succeeds (or occurs); otherwise it fails.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Roll:</strong> See “Attack Roll.”</p>
<p><strong>Concussion Hits:</strong> See “Hits.”</p>
<p><strong>Critical Strike:</strong> Unusual damage due to particularly effective attacks. <q><strong>Note:</strong> The term “critical” will often be used instead of “critical strike.”</q></p>
<p><strong>Defensive Bonus</strong> (<dfn>DB</dfn>): The total subtraction from the combat roll due to the defender’s advantages, including bonuses for the defender’s quickness, shield, armor, position, and magic items.</p>
<p><strong>Dice Roll:</strong> See “Roll.”</p>
<p><strong>Downed:</strong> When a combatant falls to the ground, he is considered downed. This does not mean prone. It is presumed that the combatant is still moving.</p>
<p><strong>Experience Level</strong> (<dfn>Level</dfn>): A character’s level is a measure of his current stage of skill development, and usually is representative of his capabilities and power.</p>
<p><strong>Fire:</strong> To make a missile attack (verb) or missile attack(s) (noun). Fumble: An especially ineffective attack or mishandling of a weapon which yields a result that is disadvantageous for the attacker.</p>
<p><strong>Gamemaster</strong> (<dfn>GM</dfn>): The gamesmaster, judge, referee, etc. The person responsible for giving life to a FRP game by creating the setting, world events and other key ingredients. He interprets situations and rules, controls non player characters, and resolves conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Hits</strong> (<dfn>Concussion Hits</dfn>): Accumulated damage, pain, and bleeding that can lead to shock, unconsciousness, and sometimes death. Each character can take a certain number of hits before passing out (determined by his “<a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Body_Development">Body Development</a>” skill).</p>
<p><strong>Initiative:</strong> The factor that determines the order in which combatants resolve their attacks, i.e., the combatant with the highest initiative attacks first.</p>
<p><strong>Level:</strong> See “Experience Level.”</p>
<p><strong>Maneuver Roll:</strong> A roll that is used to determine the results of a maneuver.</p>
<p><strong>Maneuver:</strong> An action performed by a character that requires unusual concentration, concentration under pressure, or a risk (e.g., climbing a rope, picking a lock, etc.). Maneuvers requiring movement are “<dfn>Moving Maneuvers</dfn>” (<dfn>MM</dfn>), and other maneuvers are called “<dfn>Static Maneuvers</dfn>” (<dfn>SM</dfn>).</p>
<p><strong>Melee:</strong> Hand-to-hand combat (i.e., combat not using projectiles, spells, or missiles) where opponents are physically engaged— be it a fistfight, a duel with rapiers, or a wrestling match.</p>
<p><strong>Missile weapon:</strong> In <strong><em>RM</em></strong>, this indicates a low-velocity airborne projectile, usually from a manually fired weapon. Such weapons include an arrow from a bow, a quarrel from a crossbow, a stone from a sling, etc. Thrown weapons are also included in this category. Normally, missile weapons do not include projectiles fired by explosions or other high-velocity propulsion means (e.g., guns are “projectile weapons”).</p>
<p><strong>Offensive Bonus</strong> (<dfn>OB</dfn>): Each character has an “offensive bonus” when he is using a weapon—this OB includes bonuses for the character’s stats, superior weapon, skill rank, magic items, etc. This OB is added to any attack rolls that are made when he is using that weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Orientation Roll:</strong> A roll representing a character’s degree of control following an unusual action or surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Parry:</strong> The use of part of a character’s offensive capability to effect an opponent’s attack.</p>
<p><strong>Profession</strong> (<dfn>Character Class</dfn>): A character’s profession is a reflection of his training and thought patterns; in game terms, it affects how much effort is required to develop skill in various areas of expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Projectile Weapon:</strong> As opposed to a missile weapon, this indicates a device that mechanically fires a high-velocity projectile (e.g., a gun).</p>
<p><strong>Prone:</strong> When a combatant stops moving (and usually drops to the ground), he is considered prone.</p>
<p><strong>Roll:</strong> In <em>AL</em> two different colored 10-sided dice are used to resolve any activity requiring a “Roll;” such dice are available in most hobby and toy stores. These dice can be used to obtain a variety of results. These various results are described in <a href="#AL_5.1">Section 5.1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Round:</strong> The time (10 seconds) required to perform one action. Self-reloading: Refers to any weapon which reloads (or recharges) itself and is ready for another shot almost immediately (i.e., it is capable of two attacks in the same round). Most projectile weapons fall into this category, while normal bows and thrown weapons do not. Normally self-reloading weapons only occur in FRP games in the form of magic items.</p>
<p><strong>Shot:</strong> A missile attack.</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Training in an area which influences how effectively a character is able to perform a particular action or activity. “Skill Rank” is a measure of the effectiveness of a specific skill. </p>
<p><strong>Stat</strong> (<dfn>Characteristic</dfn>): One of 10 physical and mental attributes which are considered most important to an adventurer in a FRP game. Stats dictate how well a character develops his skills, moves, fights, takes damage, absorbs information, etc. Stats in RM are gauged on a scale from 1-100. To convert from a 3-18, simply multiply by 5 and add 5.</p>
<p><strong>Stat Bonus:</strong> Each stat is assigned a bonus that is used to modify skill checks. When a stat bonus is needed, check the chart below.</p>
<p><strong>Static Action</strong> (<dfn>Static Maneuver</dfn>): An action performed by a character which requires unusual concentration, or thought under pressure, and does not involve pronounced physical movement.</p>
<p><strong>Swing:</strong> A melee attack (noun) or to make a melee attack (verb). </p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> The term “target(s)” refers to the being(s), animal(s), object(s), and/or material that a melee attack, missile attack, or spell attempts to affect.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.3/THE TACTICAL COMBAT SEQUENCE" -->
<h2><a name="AL_5.3"></a> THE TACTICAL COMBAT SEQUENCE</h2>
<p>This tactical combat sequence is based on a time frame of 10 second battle rounds and one minute turns (i.e., 6 rounds equal one turn). Normally, each combatant is allowed one attack roll per round, whether it be a spell, missile (bow and thrown fire), or melee. The rationale behind allowing missile and melee combatants only one roll every ten seconds is that, though he or she may actually swing or fire more often than this, only one effective attack is made in a round. The other swings/shots are assumed to be nullified by a shield, movement, a weapon, and/or fate.<br />
The basic principle to keep in mind is that each action takes a percentage of a round to complete. For example, one can view a physical attack as at least a 50% activity, casting a spell as a 75% activity, preparing a spell as a 90% activity, and movement as a 0-100% activity. Thus someone that casts a spell may not also make a physical attack.<br />
The time allotted to each round may vary with the game system and the preference of the GM, but the following sequence of action is recommended with rounds or turn segments of 6 to 10 seconds each.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.3.1/The Battle Round Sequence" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.3.1">5.3.1</a> The Battle Round Sequence</h3>
<p>A battle round sequence for use without <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong> is provided below.</p>
<ol>
<li> — Spell Action Phase</li>
<li> — Spell Results Phase</li>
<li> — Spell Orientation Phase</li>
<li> — Fire Phase–A</li>
<li> — Fire Result Phase–A</li>
<li> — Movement/Maneuver Phase</li>
<li> — Fire Phase–B</li>
<li> — Fire Result Phase–B</li>
<li> — Melee Phase</li>
<li> — Melee Result Phase</li>
<li> — Final Orientation Phase</li>
</ol>
<h4>SPELL PHASE (75% OR 90%)</h4>
<p>All combatants who will cast (or prepare) a spell during this round must specify any pertinent information to the GM (spell type, target, option to wait for opportunity fire, etc.).</p>
<ul>
<li> Movement/Maneuver is reduced to a maximum of 25% of normal for those who have cast a spell this round, and 10% for those who have prepared a spell.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SPELL RESULTS PHASE</h4>
<p>All “cast” (not prepared) spells specified in the previous phase are resolved simultaneously, unless an exception is indicated by the system or the GM. Effects are applied immediately, except spells held on opportunity.</p>
<ul>
<li> Movement/Maneuver is reduced to a maximum of 25% of normal for those who have cast a spell this round, and 10% for those who have prepared a spell.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SPELL ORIENTATION PHASE</h4>
<p>All combatants who performed unusual activities during the previous phase (e.g., Teleportation, etc.) must make an orientation roll to determine how well they have adapted themselves to their new surroundings. An exceptionally low roll might incapacitate them for the remainder of the round and prejudice their chance for successful action in the next round, while an exceptionally high roll would indicate the best possible result (intermediate values should be adjusted by the GM if necessary). The GM must determine what constitutes unusual activity within the context of the situation.</p>
<h4>FIRE PHASE–A (50%)</h4>
<p>All combatants who will fire during this phase must specify missile type, target/target area, and any other pertinent information. Users of self-reloading weapons (e.g., usually automatic/ semi-automatic projectile weapons) are able to fire in both this and Fire Phase B. Users of missile (bow) weapons and thrown weapons may fire in either phase, but only one. Exception: theoretically a character with a throwable weapon in each hand may throw one in Fire Phase (A) and one in Fire Phase (B).</p>
<ul>
<li> Spell casters/preparers may not fire.</li>
</ul>
<h4>FIRE RESULT PHASE–A</h4>
<p>All missile attacks specified in the previous phase are resolved simultaneously, unless an exception is indicated. All results are applied immediately. In the subsequent phases, all Phase–A firers have 50% of their activity left and thus may:</p>
<ul>
<li> Move/maneuver at 50% of normal.</li>
<li> Fire normally in Fire Phase (B) (self-reloading weapons only). </li>
<li> Melee with a -50 mod to OB.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MOVEMENT/MANEUVER PHASE (0-100%)</h4>
<p>All combatants in play may move up to the maximum of their movement allowance (depending on any activity engaged in during the earlier phases, and the movement system being used, see <a href="#AL_5.7.2">Section 5.7.2</a> for a sample system).</p>
<ul>
<li> Normally, drawing a weapon takes 20% of normal activity while changing weapons takes 50% of activity.</li>
<li> Dropping a weapon and drawing one takes 25% of activity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>FIRE PHASE–B</h4>
<p>Same as Fire Phase–A, except that a character may not fire if he has done any of the following this round:</p>
<ul>
<li> Cast/prepared a Spell.</li>
<li> Fired in Fire Phase–A and moved/maneuvered.</li>
<li> Moved/maneuvered more than 50% of normal allowance.</li>
<li> Been incapacitated and/or failed an orientation or maneuver roll.</li>
</ul>
<h4>FIRE RESULT PHASE–B</h4>
<p>The same as Fire Result Phase–A.</p>
<h4>MELEE PHASE (50%-100%)</h4>
<p>All characters may make a melee attack except those who have used more than 50% of their activity for the round. That is, they may not have done any of the following this round:</p>
<ul>
<li> Cast or prepared a spell.</li>
<li> Fired in Fire Phase–A and moved/maneuvered.</li>
<li> Moved/maneuvered and fired in Fire Phase–B.</li>
<li> Fired in Fire Phase–A and fired in Fire Phase–B.</li>
<li> Moved/maneuvered more than 50% of normal allowance.</li>
<li> Been incapacitated and/or failed an orientation or maneuver roll.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MELEE RESULT PHASE</h4>
<p>Within each group of combatants attempting to melee attack each other, attacks are resolved in the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li> Determine order in which combatants will attack by comparing initiative (quickness, and other factors, depending on circumstance); see <a href="#AL_5.6">Section 5.6</a>.</li>
<li> First combatant attack and result are applied immediately.</li>
<li> Second combatant, third combatant, etc., attack and apply results in order.</li>
<li> First combatant attacks with any useable second weapon, if any (e.g., he entered melee with a weapon in each hand, he is hasted, etc.).</li>
<li> 2nd, 3rd combatants, etc., attack with second weapon, if any.</li>
</ol>
<h4>FINAL ORIENTATION PHASE</h4>
<p>In the judgment of the GM, any combatant who has been under significant pressure (e.g., surprise), or has made an unusual maneuver may be required to make an orientation roll, which may affect his ability to act in the next round.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.3.2/EXCEPTIONS" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.3.2">5.3.2</a> EXCEPTIONS</h3>
<h4>OPPORTUNITY ACTION</h4>
<p>Combatants may plot opportunity action if they wish to perform a combat activity in a following phase of the current round or a following round. For example, a combatant may wish to withhold casting a spell until he sees who is moving where, and then cast. Opportunity action is announced during the correct phase for the desired action. Movement restrictions apply as if the combatant had actually performed the action during the correct phase. A combatant who has planned opportunity action can take no other action (except reduced movement) until the action is performed or cancelled. Opportunity action occurs first in a phase, unless otherwise indicated by the GM.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> During the spell phase, a combatant with a prepared spell announces opportunity spell casting. He may then cast the spell in any of the following phases of this and the following rounds. Until he casts the spell, he may neither melee, fire, nor make extraordinary maneuvers. He is also reduced to 25% of his normal movement until the round after he casts the spell or until he cancels this opportunity action. During a fire phase of some following round, a character attempts to fire a bow. The spell user who has planned opportunity fire now casts his spell, resolving it before the bow may be fired. If the bowman is killed or incapacitated by the spell, the bow attack will not take place.
</blockquote>
<h4>OPPORTUNITY FIRE</h4>
<p>A combatant may claim Opportunity Fire during any phase of the combat round that he would normally be able to fire, and does not (see above). He may then fire normally during a subsequent phase of the same round or a following round (and would resolve his fire before other combatants). Opportunity Fire must be claimed against a known foe (or group of foes in the same location). It may also be claimed against a terrain feature or specific area (like a window, portal, the corner of a building, etc.).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Aurum is in combat with several minions of Traegon. During Fire Phase–A, he claims Opportunity Fire on a specific minion he knows is hiding behind a big rock. During the Movement and Maneuver Phase of the next round, the minion breaks from cover and tries to run to a gully where all of his buddies are. He never makes it; Aurum throws his dagger during the Movement and Maneuver Phase and drops him.
</blockquote>
<p>Movement is restricted to 25% of normal until the action is taken or cancelled. A combatant who has declared Opportunity Fire may take no other action (except reduced movement) until the Opportunity Fire is performed or cancelled. Opportunity Fire occurs first in any given phase unless otherwise indicated by the GM. No character may fire more than once in a given phase.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Assume the same situation as given in the example above. However, this time the minion steps out from behind the rock during the Movement and Maneuver Phase, but Aurum holds his Opportunity Fire. The next phase of the combat round is Fire Phase (B). Aurum decides that he wants to take his shot now, and fires (i.e., throws) first. Aurum’s player also wants to take his normal Fire Phase (B) shot with the dagger in his other hand, but the GM indicates (quite correctly) that no combatant may fire twice in the same phase. Aurum’s player says that is unfair. The GM says (quite correctly) that Aurum’s player is unreasonable.
</blockquote>
<h4>OB PENALTIES FROM MOVEMENT/MANEUVER</h4>
<p>If a character moves/maneuvers and then fires in Fire Phase (B) or melees in Melee Phase, he takes an OB mod to that attack. The OB mod is -5 for every 5% moved/maneuvered. In order to fire or melee, the character must have moved/maneuvered less than 51% of his normal allowance and may not have performed any other activity.</p>
<h4>USING MISSILE FIRE WHILE IN MELEE</h4>
<p>Normally, a combatant cannot throw or fire missiles while engaged in melee. For these purposes, a combatant is engaged in melee if:</p>
<ol>
<li> A foe attacked him in the previous melee phase, <strong>and</strong></li>
<li> That foe is still within striking distance (i.e., usually within 5- 10'), <strong>and</strong></li>
<li> That foe’s action for the current round is to melee the combatant.</li>
</ol>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.3.3/Orientation Rolls" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.3.3">5.3.3</a> Orientation Rolls</h3>
<p>When required by the GM, a combatant must make an orientation roll to determine his degree of self-control and awareness. Roll an open-ended 1-100 roll and add the most applicable stat bonus (usually a “self-control” stat). Cross index the result on the Manuever/Movement Chart. The result is the percentage chance that the character has of orienting on the situation. Failure means disorientation and no further action is allowed for that round. Success means that the combatant is under control and aware of the situation, and may take further action that he would normally be allowed.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a minion of Traegon sneaks up on Black Oak the Druid, who is preparing to cast a divination spell. During the final orientation phase, the GM directs Black Oak to make an orientation roll to see if he notices the minion sneaking up behind him. Because the minion made a successful maneuver (a stalking maneuver) to sneak up on Black Oak, the GM assigns a degree of difficulty of “Very Hard.” Black Oak’s roll will be modified by +15 for his good Self Discipline and by -20 because Black Oak is unusually unobservant when preparing spells. He rolls a 76 for a net maneuver roll of 71 (76 + 15 - 20). Cross-indexing on the Maneuver/Movement Chart, we get a result of “30”. This means that Black Oak only has a 30% chance of noticing the minion; Black Oak makes a second roll of 72 and thus is completely oblivious to the danger approaching him from the rear. The GM should not allow Black Oak to take any actions to react to the threat of the minion.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.3.4/Movement Conflicts" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.3.4">5.3.4</a> Movement Conflicts</h3>
<p>When two or more combatants attempt to perform conflicting movements or maneuvers (such as two characters who are headed for the same space), the GM may choose to resolve the conflict by having the combatants in question make maneuver rolls (see <a href="#AL_5.7.1">Section 5.7.1</a>). If one character succeeds and the other fails, the result is obvious. Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li> The conflict can be considered a draw, and movement for the involved parties can be terminated at the point of conflict; <strong>or</strong></li>
<li> The GM can use a comparison of maneuver rolls (higher roll having choice of position) and by common sense. A combination of the two is possible, where one of the characters, due to position, might have an add to his maneuver roll, but phenomenal luck could still beat him.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases of conflicting movement, the GM will ultimately have to decide the outcome of the conflict. The maneuver rolls of the involved parties are intended to aid him in his decision.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.3.5/Canceling Action" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.3.5">5.3.5</a> Canceling Action</h3>
<p>During a round an action declared by a combatant may be canceled before it would otherwise be resolved. A character who has canceled his action may perform one of the following alternative actions:</p>
<ul>
<li> Melee with half of his normal ability.</li>
<li> Move half his normal (not running) movement. </li>
<li> Make a maneuver modified by -30.</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternative action chosen <strong>must</strong> be performed when the other actions of that type are normally resolved.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.3.6/HASTE" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.3.6">5.3.6</a> HASTE</h3>
<p>Certain spells will modify the normal turn sequence to some degree. The most common of these modifications will be Haste. A person who is hasted will basically have 200% normal activity, but must abide by the sequence restrictions. That is, whatever activity the person takes will have to occur in the proper phase (thus, a hasted person could not move, fight and then move again). A hasted person could fire a bow, move, and then melee, or attack twice in a melee phase (once at the beginning and once at the end). </p>
<ul>
<li> A hasted character may not fire more than twice a round.</li>
<li> Casting more than one spell/round is still prohibited.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Haste also has certain liabilities: e.g., a hasted character expends exhaustion points (see <a href="#AL_5.7.2">Section 5.7.2</a>) at double normal rate, a bleeding wound bleeds at double normal rate, all other wounds have a 25% chance of “bleeding” 1 point per round, etc.

<h2><a name="AL_5.4">5.4</a> DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES</h2>
<p>In combat, there are many variables which affect the severity of an attack. The defender has several factors which work in his favor, including: armor, shield, quickness, special items, and the ability to parry (i.e., decrease attack effectiveness in the interest of self-preservation). Armor is the basic classification of protection, while all other defensive capabilities are expressed in terms of a Defensive Bonus (DB) which will modify the attacker’s combat roll in the defender’s favor.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.4.1/Armor" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.4.1">5.4.1</a> Armor</h3>
<p><strong><em>Rolemaster (RM)</em></strong> armor is the basic protective capability assigned to the material covering the body, and is divided into five categories of four <em>Armor Types</em> (<dfn>AT</dfn>s) each (for a total of 20 types).</p>
<div align="center">Cloth-Skin Base<br />Soft Leather Base<br />Rigid Leather Base<br />Chain Mail Base<br />Plate Base</div>
<h4>CLOTH-SKIN BASE</h4>
<p>Normal cloth attire, robes, and normal animal hides.</p>
<p><strong>Skin</strong> (<dfn>AT 1</dfn>): Normal clothing, assumed if other covering is not
specified.</p>
<p><strong>Robes</strong> (<dfn>AT 2</dfn>): Full-length robes normally worn by spell users and certain other combatants.</p>
<p><strong>Light Hide</strong> (<dfn>AT 3</dfn>): The natural hide of common classes of animals (e.g., Deer, Dog, Wolf).</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Hide</strong> (<dfn>AT 4</dfn>): The natural hide of uncommon classes of animals (e.g., Buffalo, Elephant, Bear). The GM will have to decide on the armor type of the creatures that populate his game.</p>
<h4>SOFT LEATHER BASE</h4>
<p>The heavy outer garments normally worn as weather protection by certain civilians and as combat protection by some militia and irregulars.</p>
<p><strong>Leather Jerkin</strong> (<dfn>AT 5</dfn>): A leather vest-like covering without arms and reaching only to the waist or mid-thigh.</p>
<p><strong>Leather Coat</strong> (<dfn>AT 6</dfn>): A leather coat covering the arms and to mid-thigh.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforced Leather Coat</strong> (<dfn>AT 7</dfn>): A leather coast covering the arms and to mid-thigh, but with either rigid-leather sections or metal sections sewn in for reinforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforced Full-Length Leather Coat</strong> (<dfn>AT 8</dfn>): A reinforced leather coat (as above) that covers to the lower leg.</p>
<h4>RIGID LEATHER BASE</h4>
<p>Rigid leather armor and the rigid hide covering of certain reptiles and of fantastic creatures such as Dragons.</p>
<p><strong>Leather Breastplate</strong> (<dfn>AT 9</dfn>): A rigid breastplate covering the torso to mid-thigh and part of the upper arms.</p>
<p><strong>Leather Breastplate and Greaves</strong> (<dfn>AT 10</dfn>): As above, but with leather greaves covering the forearms and lower legs.</p>
<p><strong>Half-Hide Plate</strong> (<dfn>AT 11</dfn>): Rigid-leather armor that covers the body completely; includes the hide of certain creatures that contain at least a few rigid plates (e.g., Rhinoceros, Alligator).</p>
<p><strong>Full-Hide Plate</strong> (<dfn>AT 12</dfn>): As half-hide plate (above), except that the rigid leather or plates are harder and/or more plentiful (e.g., Turtles, certain Dragons, Giant Crabs).</p>
<h4>CHAIN MAIL BASE</h4>
<p>Chain link armor, scale armor, and the hides of certain fantastic creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Chain Shirt</strong> (<dfn>AT 13</dfn>): A chain mail shirt covering the torso to mid-thigh and half of the upper arms.</p>
<p><strong>Chain Shirt and Greaves</strong> (<dfn>AT 14</dfn>): As above, but with greaves on the forearms and lower legs.</p>
<p><strong>Full Chain</strong> (<dfn>AT 15</dfn>): Chain mail covering most of the body and legs in the form of a shirt and leggings.</p>
<p><strong>Chain Hauberk</strong> (<dfn>AT 16</dfn>): A full-length chain mail coat split from the waist in the front and back to facilitate movement. Certain Dragons may also be of this armor type.</p>
<h4>PLATE BASE</h4>
<p>Rigid armor of metal plates and the heaviest animal hides.</p>
<p><strong>Metal Breastplate</strong> (<dfn>AT 17</dfn>): A metal breastplate plus smaller plates covering the torso to mid-thigh and part of the upper arms.</p>
<p><strong>Metal Breastplate and Greaves</strong> (<dfn>AT 18</dfn>): As above, but with greaves on the forearms and lower legs.</p>
<p><strong>Half Plate</strong> (<dfn>AT 19</dfn>): Rigid plate armor covering the body, but with chain mail between the plates, at the joints, and covering the legs.</p>
<p><strong>Full Plate</strong> (<dfn>AT 20</dfn>): Rigid plate armor as half plate above, but with plates overlapping at joints, and plate armor covering the legs.</p>
<h4>ARMOR PENALTIES</h4>
<p>Due to its weight and constrictive nature, there are penalties associated with wearing armor while attempting to maneuver, defend, and throw/fire missiles. These penalties are detailed in the Armor Chart, <a href="#AL_5.4.3">Section 5.4.3</a>, <a href="#AL_5.5.2">Section 5.5.2</a>, and <a href="#AL_5.7">Section 5.7</a>.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.4.2/Shields" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.4.2">5.4.2</a> Shields</h3>
<p>Shields are represented in combat by a bonus to the wielder’s Defensive Bonus. In addition, when fighting with one or two weapons, one weapon may be used as a “shield,” but may not be used for an attack in the same round. A shield bonus may only be used against one opponent’s attack(s) per round.<br />
These bonuses and other factors concerning shields and parrying are summarized in the Shield-Parry Chart.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.4.3/Parrying" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.4.3">5.4.3</a> Parrying</h3>
<p>A defender may wish to place more emphasis on personal defense than is implicit in the combat system. Therefore, a combatant may wish to sacrifice some or all of his Offensive Bonus (OB) with the weapon he is presently using, in order to increase his DB (see <a href="#AL_5.4.4">Section 5.4.4</a>). Such an action is called parrying, though it may be thought of in many combat situations as dodging.<br />
The premise of sacrificing offensive capabilities in order to increase one’s defensive capability is a fundamental component in this combat system.</p>
<h4>PARRYING MELEE ATTACKS</h4>
<p>A defender may parry a melee attack during the Melee Phase of the combat round by switching any or all of his OB (with the Melee weapon he is using during the Melee Phase) to DB. All points of OB so switched are converted to enhance DB.</p>
<ul>
<li> The designation of this “OB/DB split” is done for all combatants at the beginning of the Melee Phase.</li>
<li> To parry a Melee attack, the defender must be aware that he will be subject to the attack.</li>
<li> He must also have a shield, suitable terrain, or a Melee weapon. Some weapons may only be used to parry with a certain percentage of the wielder’s OB.</li>
<li> A combatant may only parry the foe that he attacks.</li>
<li> If a combatant elects to parry with a weapon with his entire OB, he receives the “shield” bonus for his weapon. However, he must still make an attack with a +0 OB. These bonuses are listed on the Shield-Parry Chart.</li>
</ul>
<h4>PARRYING MISSILE FIRE</h4>
<p>As with melee parrying, a defender parrying a missile may reduce his OB, in whole or in part, and shift that bonus to his DB. To parry a missile attack:</p>
<ul>
<li> The defender must be aware that he will be subject to the attack.</li>
<li> He must also have a shield (a weapon won’t do) or suitable terrain with which to parry the missile.</li>
<li> When parrying missile fire, the shift must be declared at the beginning of Fire Phase (A) and is only applicable against one missile attack.</li>
<li> Parrying a missile attack requires 50% of a character’s normal activity for a round.</li>
</ul>
<h4>PARRYING LIMITATIONS</h4>
<p>A combatant may use part of his OB for missile parrying, another part for melee parrying, and another part for a melee attack; but the sum of these may not exceed his normal OB total. A summary of parrying limitations may be found in the Shield-Parry Chart.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Tendrill has a DB of 50 and an OB of 85. He parries a missile (using his shield) during the Missile Phase with 25 of his OB, resulting in a DB against that attack of 75. Then, during the Melee Phase, he parries a melee attack with 10 of his OB, resulting in a DB of 60 against that attack. Thus, he has a 50 OB left for his own melee attack for the round.
</blockquote>
<h4>THE IMPORTANCE OF PARRYING</h4>
<p><em>AL</em> is based upon the assumption that characters will use the option of parrying to protect themselves. In a face to face battle, only berserkers, idiots, and desperate characters always use their entire OB in attack. Such characters usually do not last long unless they have something special going for them (e.g., incredible armor, incredible luck, super healing facilities, etc.). In most situations a character will and should use part of his OB to attack with and the rest to increase his DB and thus protect himself. Of course, in certain situations it is often wise for a character to attack with his entire OB. For example, when attacking a foe who cannot attack back; or perhaps when facing multiple opponents.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.4.4/DEFENSIVE BONUS" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.4.4">5.4.4</a> DEFENSIVE BONUS</h3>
<p>The sum of all bonuses and penalties which affect the defender’ s susceptibility to being hit and damaged in combat is called the Defensive Bonus (DB). It is the number that is subtracted from the attacker’s combat roll. The defender’s DB is composed of bonuses for superior/inferior armor, quickness, position and cover, special items, and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> skill (see below). A defender may also parry (i.e., dodge) incoming attacks by forgoing a portion of his own attack ability (see <a href="#AL_5.4.3">Section 5.4.3</a>). The Defensive Modification Chart summarizes the factors which affect a defender’s DB.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Bonus</strong> =<br />
+ <em>Armor Quality</em> Bonus<br />
+ (<em>Quickness</em> Stat Bonus - Armor Quickness Penalty)<br />
+ <em>Adrenal Defense</em> Skill Bonus<br />
+ <em>Position</em> and <em>Cover</em> Bonuses<br />
+ <em>Special Item</em> Bonuses<br />
+ <em>Shield</em> Bonus (see <a href="#AL_5.4.2">Section 5.4.2</a>)<br />
+ <em>Parrying</em> Bonus (see <a href="#AL_5.4.3">Section 5.4.3</a>)</p>
<h4>Armor Quality</h4>
<p>Especially good armor in terms of material, construction, or enchantment does not change that armor’s basic type, but rather adds a bonus to the wearer’s DB. Conversely, shoddy armor will incur a penalty to the wearer’s DB. It is highly recommended that Superior Armor bonuses rarely exceed +10 or +15.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Kiltran, a rather successful Ranger, wears a Chain Shirt and Greaves (AT 14) taken from the lifeless body of a follower of the Bearer of the Root. The GM has decided that this armor is of superior construction (being make by a highly revered Dwarven smith) and so awards it a +10 quality bonus. This armor is thus AT 14(10).

<h4>QUICKNESS STAT BONUS</h4>
<p>A combatant’s DB is modified by his quickness stat bonus or penalty (see <a href="AL_5.2">Section 5.2</a> for a chart converting stats and stat bonuses). If the defender is wearing certain types of cumbersome armor, his quickness stat bonus may be reduced or eliminated completely (but never below zero); see the Armor Chart. A defender only has his quickness stat bonus factored into his DB if he is aware that he is in a combat situation and is free to move.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Lotus, a T’sbalic warrior, has a temporary quickness stat score of 98. Unencumbered by armor, Lotus is AT 1(20) (i.e., her DB is 20) when in a combat situation and free to move. Lotus now puts on an metal breastplate which reduces her quickness stat bonus by 10. Now when she is in combat, barring other modifiers, Lotus is AT 17(10).

<h4>ADRENAL DEFENSE</h4>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> is a skill which adds to a defender’s DB. This is a very restrictive DB factor. Normally, the combatant must be aware of his attacker, may not be carrying any heavy items or any weapons (other than those he uses in a weapon kata), and may not be wearing armor. If a defender is using Adrenal Defense, the full skill bonus may be used against melee attacks, while only half of the normal skill bonus may be used against missile attacks.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> See the RM Standard Rules for more information on Adrenal Defense and other Martial Arts skills.
</blockquote>
<h4>POSITION AND COVER</h4>
<p>The GM may award a variable bonus to a defender if his position is judged to be advantageous. Penalties due to a defender’ s disadvantageous position are reflected in modifications to the attacker’s Offensive Bonus (see <a href="#AL_5.5">Section 5.5</a>).<br />
Cover bonuses against missile attacks should be based upon the percentage of the defender’s body protected and the ability of cover to stop incoming fire. Here are some sample missile attack cover bonuses.</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><td> Half “Soft” Cover </td><td> +20 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Full “Soft” Cover </td><td> +40 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Half “Hard” Cover </td><td> +50 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Full “Hard” Cover </td><td> +100 </td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If a combatant is completely protected by cover, and is making no attack himself, the GM may rule that no attack may be made against him.
</blockquote><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Kiltran, wondering why he ever joined the Confused Young Lords, finds himself defending behind a low stone wall against Traegon and Yrzan. During combat, Kiltran stands to fire his bow. The wall rises to his waist, protecting him from his foes’ missile fire. The GM awards Kiltran a cover bonus of 50 to his DB (maybe overly generous, but the GM knows that Kiltran is going to need every bit of it).
</blockquote>
<h4>SPECIAL ITEMS</h4>
<p>There may be special items (usually magic items) in a GM’s campaign which will impart a DB to their possessors. These may range from unique magical artifacts to lucky charms. Their design/strength is subject to the GM’s devising.</p>
<h4>SHIELDS</h4>
<p>As described in <a href="#AL_5.4.2">Section 5.4.2</a>, a shield or a weapon used as a shield will impart a bonus to the wearer’s DB against one opponent’s attacks.</p>
<h4>Parrying</h4>
<p>As described in <a href="#AL_5.4.3">Section 5.4.3</a>, a defender may commit part of his OB to increase his DB against one attack.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.5/OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES" -->
<h2><a name="AL_5.5">5.5</a> OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES</h2>
<p>The success of an attack will depend heavily on the weapon or weapon combination used (<a href="#AL_5.1">Section 5.1</a>) <strong>and</strong> the offensive capabilities possessed by the attacker (<a href="#AL_5.2">Section 5.2</a>). The offensive factors that can affect an attack roll include: expertise, physical prowess, experience, superior/inferior weapon(s), weapon combination, special equipment, position, status of the defender and status of the attacker. The sum of all bonuses and penalties related to the attacker is called the Offensive Bonus (OB).</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.5.1/Weapon Combinations" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.5.1">5.5.1</a> Weapon Combinations</h3>
<p>A combatant’s capabilities in combat often depend upon what weapons he uses. The normal weapon combinations are: no melee weapon, one-handed weapon, a one-handed weapon with a shield, a two-handed weapon, and two one-handed weapons.</p>
<h4>NO MELEE WEAPON</h4>
<p>Normally a combatant without a melee weapon may not attack and may not parry with his OB (see <a href="#AL_5.4.3">Section 5.4.3</a>). However, if such a combatant has a substantial object in his hands capable of blocking a weapon blow (e.g., a stool, a mattress, a log, a body), he may be given a shield bonus for the item. In such a case, a GM may even allow the combatant to make an attack. Usually, these attacks should be resolved on the Brawling Attack Table. An object used to parry in this manner may be broken or damaged.<br />
In a similar manner, a combatant may “parry” with suitable terrain features (e.g., dodge around a tree, duck under a large branch, step behind a door). As always, the GM is the final judge as to the appropriateness of such “parrying” situations.</p>
<h4>ONE-HANDED WEAPONS</h4>
<p>A combatant armed with a single one-handed weapon may attack once per round and parry normally (see <a href="#AL_5.4.3">Section 5.4.3</a>).</p>
<h4>ONE-HANDED WEAPONS WITH A SHIELD</h4>
<p>A combatant armed with a one-handed weapon and a shield may attack normally once per round and parry normally (see <a href="#AL_3.3">Section 3.3</a>). Such a combatant may use his shield bonus for his DB against one foe and then use his parry bonus against the foe he attacks. Alternatively, he may use both bonuses against the same foe.</p>
<h4>TWO-HANDED WEAPONS</h4>
<p>For normal human-sized creatures, these types of weapons require both hands to wield. Thus, they can not be used with a shield. A combatant using a two-handed weapon may only use 50% of his OB to parry an opponent using a one-handed weapon.</p>
<h4>TWO ONE-HANDED WEAPONS</h4>
<p>A combatant may use a one-handed weapon in each of his hands. When a combatant develops skill with (i.e., trains with) a weapon, he must develop the skill with his dominant hand and skill with the non-dominant hand separately.</p>
<ul>
<li> Any weapon used in the non-dominant hand automatically gets a -20 modification to the combatant’s OB with that weapon.</li>
<li> The combatant may attack with both weapons in the same round; he may attack with only one and use the other for its “shield” bonus versus melee (see the Shield-Parry Chart).</li>
<li> If a combatant uses part of his OBs for parrying, he must decrease both his weapon OBs by that amount.</li>
<li> A combatant must direct both his attacks (and parry) against the same target.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Notes for Polearms and Thrown Weapons</h3>
<p>Combatants in the second line should be allowed to strike past friendly combatants (front line) if they are using pole arms. This serves to simulate the effectiveness of organized groups of fighters with pole arms. The GM should determine whether the front line combatants and second line combatants are adequately trained for this type of combat.<br />
If a stationary combatant is trained with a particular type of throwing weapon, he may throw that weapon using 80% of his normal OB <strong>and</strong> still melee in the same round with only a -20 modification to his melee OB. Such a combatant may only use a one-handed weapon <strong>or</strong> a one-handed weapon and a shield on the round that he throws the weapon. (He is assumed to be holding his melee weapon in his non-throwing hand.)</p>

<h3><a name="AL_5.5.2">5.5.2</a> OFFENSIVE BONUS</h3>
<p>The Offensive Bonus is added to the attacker’s combat roll during the resolution of a given attack. Below is a descriptive listing of the factors which contribute to a combatant’s OB for a specific weapon and a specific situation. The Offensive Modification Chart summarizes the factors which affect a defender’s DB.</p>
<p><strong>Offensive Bonus</strong> =<br />

- Armor Missile Attack Penalty (Armor Chart)</p>
<h4>Skill – Expertise</h4>
<p>A combatant with expertise in handling a certain weapon receives a “skill bonus” for his weapon.<br />
Expertise in <strong><em>RM</em></strong> is measured in terms of skill ranks. The higher the number of skill ranks one possesses in a given weapon skill, the higher the resultant OB will be. For the purposes of these guidelines, this bonus is:</p>
<ul>
<li> +5 for each of skill ranks 1 to 10</li>
<li> +2 for each of 10 skill ranks 11 to 20</li>
<li> +1 for each of 10 skill ranks 21 to 30</li>
<li> +1/2 for every skill rank over Skill Rank 30.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A combatant with Skill Rank 13 with a mace would have a skill bonus with the mace of 56 = (10 x 5) + (3 x 2).
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="#AL_5.9">Section 5.9</a> for conversion notes on how to determine a character’s OB from a non-skill based system.</p>
<h4>Stats – Physical Prowess</h4>
<p>A combatant with extraordinary physical strength and/or agility may receive a “stat bonus” for his OB. For unusually weak
and/or clumsy characters this bonus may actually be negative. Use the chart in <a href="#AL_5.2">Section 5.2</a> to determine the stat bonus for the type of weapon used.</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><td>Weapon Type</td><td>Applicable Stat</td></tr>
<tr><td>Melee</td><td>Strength</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bows, Slings</td><td>Agility</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thrown</td><td>Strength</td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Elor has a Strength of 95, so his melee stat bonus is +15.
</blockquote>
<h4>Profession</h4>
<p>Certain character professions get a bonus to their OB.<br />
See the descriptions of character professions to determine if a given combatant is entitled to such a bonus to the OB (see <a href="#AL_5.9.2">Section 5.9.2</a> for level and profession conversions).</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><td>Profession</td><td>Profession Bonus</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fighter</td><td>+20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thief</td><td>+10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rogue</td><td>+15</td></tr>
<tr><td>Warrior Monk </td><td>+10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ranger</td><td>+5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Others</td><td>no profession bonus</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Weapon Quality</h4>
<p>Weapons that are remarkable in material, construction, or workmanship may add a bonus to a combatant’s OB (or a penalty for inferior weapons). It is strongly suggested that bonuses for superior quality weapons rarely exceed +10 or +15.<br />
To determine the weapon bonus for a non-thrown missile attack, average the firing device’s (i.e., bow or sling) bonus with missile’s (i.e., arrow, quarrel, or stone) bonus and round off.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A +10 composite bow firing a +5 arrow would have a weapon bonus of +8 = (10 + 5) / 2.
</blockquote>
<h4>Special Items</h4>
<p>There may be special items (usually magic items) in a GM’s campaign which will impart a OB modification to their possessors. These may range from unique magical artifacts to lucky charms. Their design/strength is subject to the GM’s devising.</p>
<h4>Position</h4>
<p>At the GM’s discretion, a bonus or penalty may adjust a combatant’s OB if his position is determined to be somehow superior or inferior to his opponent’s. See the Offensive Modifications Chart.<br />
Unless stated otherwise, position bonuses are cumulative. For example, a surprise rear attack would get a total position bonus of at least +55: +20 for surprise, +20 for rear attack, and +15 for a flank attack. A non-surprise rear attack would get a total position bonus of +35.</p>
<h4>Status</h4>
<p>A summary of the various status modifiers to an OB are listed in the Offensive Modifications Chart.</p>
<h4>Parrying</h4>
<p>As discussed in <a href="#AL_5.4.3">Section 5.4.3</a>, a combatant’s OB is lowered for a specific attack by the amount he uses to parry.</p>
<h4>Non-dominant Hand Use</h4>
<p>As discussed in <a href="#AL_5.5.1">Section 5.5.1</a>, a weapon used in the non-dominant hand receives a special -20 OB modification.</p>
<h4>Range</h4>
<p>There is a modification to the firer’s OB based upon the distance from the firer to the target. These modifications range from +30 to -75 and are provided on the Weapon Attack Tables (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-2.1">2.1</a> – <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-2.29">2.29</a>).<br />
The missile ranges given on each of the attack tables are the <em>maximum</em> ranges for which each of the given OB modifications apply. For example on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-2.5">Composite Bow Attack Table (2.5)</a>, attacks made at a range of 0'-10' are modified by +25, attacks at a range of 11'-100' receive no modification, attacks at 101'-200' are modified by -35, attacks at 201'-300' are modified by -60, and attacks over 300' are not allowed.</p>
<h4>Reloading</h4>
<p>The preparation (i.e., reloading) time required between missile attacks is dependent upon the type of weapon and how accurate the firer is attempting to be. The chart below gives the firer’s OB penalty due to reloading.<br />
The act of firing the weapon always takes one round and requires 50% of the firer’s activity (as specified earlier in the rules). A combatant preparing a shot (i.e., reloading) may still take 20% of his normal activity. The figures presented in the table assume the bow is strung and arrows/quarrels (or pellets) are available in quivver (or pouch). If a bow has to be strung, the following rounds are added to the preparation time:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><td>Short Bow </td><td> +2 rounds </td></tr>
<tr><td>Composite Bow </td><td> 3 rounds </td></tr>
<tr><td>Long Bow </td><td> 3 rounds</td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> See <a href="#AL_5.8.4">Section 5.8.4</a> for optional reloading rules that express reloading in terms of a combatants % activity for a round.
</blockquote>
<h4>Armor Missile Attack Penalties</h4>
<p>A combatant making a missile attack receives a penalty to his OB if he is wearing armor that covers his arms. This includes armor types 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 20. The specific penalties are summarized on the Armor Chart.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.6/COMBAT RESOLUTION" -->
<h2><a name="AL_5.6">5.6</a> COMBAT RESOLUTION</h2>
<p>A melee or missile attack is resolved by cross-indexing the net attack roll with the target’s armor type (AT) on the correct Attack Table for the weapon being used. The effects of Fumbles and Critical Strikes are found on the correct Fumble Table or the appropriate Critical Strike Table. In each fire phase, all attacks are treated as simultaneous. For melee, first determine the order in which the combatants will swing; then resolve each attack in sequence, implementing the results immediately.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.6.1/Initiative Determination" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.6.1">5.6.1</a> Initiative Determination</h3>
<p>The quickest combatant normally swings first in a melee, but this may be be modified based on a number of factors, including weapon size, weight, etc.<br />
Each combatant should total his initiative points; these points are summarized on the Initiative Determination Chart. The combatant with the largest total swings first, then the second largest total, and so on. After all combatants that have melee attacks have made one attack, those capable of making a second melee attack (i.e., those with two weapons or those who are hasted) calculate their initiative points for their second attacks. These attacks are then resolved as outlined above.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.6.2/Attack Resolution" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.6.2">5.6.2</a> Attack Resolution</h3>
<p>The net attack roll is the attack roll (high open-ended) plus the attacker’s OB minus the defender’s DB. Referring to the attack table corresponding to the attacker’s weapon or attack type, this result is cross-indexed with the defender’s armor type onto arrive at the result of the attack. The armor types are the numbers, 1-20, across the top of each attack chart.<br />
In certain cases where an attack is especially bad or good, another roll may be required to determine the results of a Failure or Critical Strike.<br />
The attack tables include 29 weapons (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_2.1">2.1</a>–<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_2.29">2.29</a>) and 13 special attacks (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_3.1">3.1</a>–<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_3.13">3.13</a>). Each one takes into account the capabilities of the weapon or attack type as well as the protective factor and mobility of the armor type.</p>
<h4>THE ATTACK ROLL</h4>
<p>An attack is represented by rolling d100 (high open-ended, see <a href="#AL_5.2">Section 5.2</a>). The result is the Attack Roll for that attack.</p>
<p>UNMODIFIED ROLLS</p>
<p>An Attack Roll of 01-10 may indicate an immediate effect, in which case, no modifications are applied.</p>
<ul>
<li> An unmodified roll of 01-02 for a special attack (tables <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_3.1">3.1</a>–<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_3.13">3.13</a>) indicates a Fumble (see <a href="#AL_5.6.3">Section 5.6.3</a>). Such an attack has no effect on the defender and may affect the attacker.</li>
<li> For a weapon attack, if the Attack Roll falls within the weapon’s “Fumble Range,” the attacker “fumbles” his weapon (see <a href="#AL_5.6.3">Section 5.6.3</a>). These fumble ranges are printed on the appropriate weapon attack tables (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_2.1">2.1</a>–<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_2.29">2.29</a>). Such an attack has no effect on the defender and may affect the attacker (see <a href="#AL_5.6.3">Section 5.6.3</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>“96-100” ATTACK ROLL</h4>
<p>An Attack Roll is a “high open-ended roll.” As outlined in <a href="#AL_5.2">Section 5.2</a>, if such a roll is between 96 and 100, a particularly effective attack has been made. The dice are rolled again and the result is added to the first roll. If the second roll is 96-00, then a third roll is made and added, and so on until a non 96-00 roll is made. The total sum of these rolls is the result of the high open- ended roll; in this case it is the result of the Attack Roll.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> An initial Attack Roll is 97, so the dice are rolled again with a result of 99. Thus, the dice are rolled again with a result of 04. This Attack Roll is 98 + 99 + 04, for a total of 201.
</blockquote>
<h4>THE NET ATTACK ROLL</h4>
<p>If the Attack Roll does not indicate a Fumble or a Failure, the net attack roll is determined by adding the OB to the Attack Roll and subtracting the defender’s DB.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.6.3/Fumble Results" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.6.3">5.6.3</a> Fumble Results</h3>
<p>If an attack results in a fumble (see <a href="#AL_5.6.2">Section 5.6.2</a>), a roll must be made and cross-indexed on the appropriate fumble table (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-4.13">4.13</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-4.14">4.14</a>) with the column that applies to the weapon being used. The result is immediately applied to the attacker.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Croe the Half-dwarven Fighter playfully swings his battle axe at “his friend” Blaize, an Elven Sheeplord. His attack roll is 04 and thus falls into the fumble range for a battle axe (i.e., 01-05)—Croe fumbles his weapon. As Blaize begins to laugh, Croe makes a roll of 83 and cross-indexes it with the “Hand Arms (2-hand)” column on the Fumble Table—Croe juggles his weapon for 3 rounds and thus may not attack; he can still parry. If Blaize can stop laughing, he can attempt to fry the juggling Half-dwarf with his magic trident. If Croe’s initial roll had been an 06 or better, he would not have fumbled and he would have resolved his attack normally.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.6.4/Non-Fumble Results" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.6.4">5.6.4</a> Non-Fumble Results</h3>
<p>If an attack does not result in a fumble, the net attack roll is cross-indexed with the defender’s armor type on the appropriate attack table—Tables <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-2.1">2.1</a>–<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-2.29">2.29</a> for weapons and <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-3.1">3.1</a>–<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-3.13">3.13</a> for special attacks. Treat net attack rolls of more than 150 as 150.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Myrmanthia makes an attack roll of 87 and has an OB of 100 with her composite bow. Her target has an AT of 15 and a DB of 30, so her net attack roll is 157. However, since this is greater than 150, it is treated as 150. Cross-indexing AT 15 with a net attack roll of 150, we get a result of “22EP.”
</blockquote>
<p>Note that each of the special attack tables (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-3.1">3.1</a>–<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-3.13">3.13</a>) has four “maximum result” thresholds. An attack’s net attack roll cannot exceed the designated threshold; instead, the maximum allowed result is used as the net attack roll.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> An animal makes a Medium Claw attack against AT13. The net attack roll is 132, but the threshold for Medium attacks is 120. Thus, the net attack roll used is 120, and the result is “13CP.”
</blockquote>
<p>A typical result from an attack table will have three components, for example:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>22 E P</strong></p>
<p>The first component will be a number from 1 on up, which is the number of concussion hits delivered to the target. The second component is a letter describing the severity of a critical strike (if any—no letter indicates that no critical strike was delivered). The third component is only present if the second component is present; it is a letter indicating the type of critical strike. In the example above, the target has taken 17 concussion hits and a Puncture type critical of 'E' level severity. If the critical severity is given but not the critical type, the critical type is indicated on the appropriate attack table.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Note:</strong> Krush type criticals are indicated by a 'K' result in order to distinguish them from 'C' level severity results.
</blockquote>
<p>If the result on the table is a “—,” no damage is delivered.</p>
<h4>Concussion Hits</h4>
<p>A number result from an attack indicates that the defender receives that many concussion hits.<br />
Each combatant has a limited number of concussion hits (see <a href="#AL_5.9">Section 5.9</a>). When the limit is exceeded, the combatant is rendered unconscious and can take no further action until he is back under the limit. Death may be caused if this limit is exceed by a certain amount (see <a href="#AL_5.9">Section 5.9</a>).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Note:</strong> The point at which death occurs is based upon the combatant’s physical constitution, and depends on the system used for deriving physical characteristics. The GM must decide on the point at which death results (e.g., 2 times the number of concussion hits causing unconsciousness could result in the victim’s death, or, alternatively, the number of concussion hits causing unconsciousness added to the victim’s Constitution on a 1-100 scale).
</blockquote>
<h4>Critical Strikes</h4>
<p>A result of a number followed by one or two letters indicates that the defender receives a number of concussion hits (see above) <strong>and</strong> a critical strike.<br />
The first letter (or the only letter) indicates the severity of the critical. The severity of a critical strike (or just critical) ranges from 'A' (least severe) to 'E' (most severe) with the letters 'F' indicating multiple criticals as detailed on the special tables.<br />
The second letter (if any) indicates the critical type. Criticals of this type are: <strong>S</strong>lash, <strong>P</strong>uncture, <strong>K</strong>rush, <strong>G</strong>rapple, <strong>U</strong>nbalance, and <strong>T</strong>iny. If there is only one letter, the critical type is indicated on the appropriate attack table. Criticals of this type are: Martial Arts Striking, Martial Arts Sweeps &amp; Throws, and Brawling.<br />
When a critical is indicated, a second roll (1-100, not open-ended) is made and the result is cross-indexed with the severity of the critical ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'E'). The critical table used corresponds to the critical type.<br />
Certain critical strikes have an 'F' severity, indicating two normal critical strikes should be applied to the target. A single roll is made for both criticals and all results are applied cumulatively. The type and severity of these criticals is provided at the bottom of the appropriate attack table.</p>
<h4>Criticals against Large and Super-Large Creatures</h4>
<p>Certain unusual creatures are so large and/or powerful that the normal critical strike tables are not used when they receive critical strikes. Unusual creatures are separated into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li> Large Creatures (Trolls, Giants, Demons, and Undead, etc.).</li>
<li> Super-Large Creatures (Dragons, very powerful Demons, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category has its own critical strike table that is consulted if a sufficiently severe critical strike is obtained against them. The roll for criticals against Large and Super-Large creatures is high open-ended.</p>
<h4>LARGE CREATURE CRITICAL STRIKES</h4>
<p>Only critical strikes of severity 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'E' affect large creatures (i.e., 'A' severity criticals are ignored). A high open-ended roll is made and cross-indexed with the weapon type on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-4.4">Large Creature Critical Strike Table (4.4)</a>. The result obtained is applied immediately.<br />
Note that the severity of the critical strike is irrelevant, except that it must be of 'B' severity or higher. This reflects the fact that such creatures present such a large target that they are much more difficult to seriously hurt.</p>
<h4>SUPER-LARGE CREATURE CRITICAL STRIKES</h4>
<p>Only critical strikes of severity 'D' or 'E' affect super-large creatures (i.e., 'A', 'B', and 'C' severity criticals are ignored). A high open-ended roll is made and cross-indexed with the weapon type on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-4.10">Super-Large Creature Critical Strike Table (4.10)</a>. The result obtained is applied immediately.<br />
This table should be consulted of only for creatures such as Dragons, Dinosaurs, and the most powerful Demons.</p>
<h4>SLAYING CRITICALS</h4>
<p>Some Large and Super-Large creatures are especially vulnerable to certain magical weapons (e.g., a Troll is vulnerable to a weapon of “Troll-slaying”). If a critical is obtained with such a weapon against a Large or Super-Large creature, the “Slaying” column on the appropriate table is used.<br />
If a critical strike is obtained when using a weapon of slaying against a man-sized creature (e.g., an Orc-slaying sword used against an Orc), the normal critical is resolved and then a second critical is resolved on the slaying column of the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-4.4">Large Creature Critical Strike Table (4.4)</a>, using the same roll that was used for the normal critical.</p>
<h4>Critical Interpretations</h4>
<p>Most of the critical strike results are self-explanatory. However, certain results may have to be modified due to circumstances.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A target behind a low stone wall is hit by an arrow and receives a critical calling for damage to his ankle. Instead the GM should rule that he is hit in the wrist. Note that he already receives a defensive bonus for being behind the stone wall and was hit in spite of it. Similarly, if a critical strike calling for an unspecified limb to be broken is rolled, the limb affected should be determined randomly.
</blockquote>
<h4>OVERALL GUIDELINES</h4>
<ul>
<li> All damage (including concussion hits), unless otherwise noted, is only applicable to the target combatant.</li>
<li> Often bleeding, bruises, burns, frostbite, etc. indicated on the critical strike tables are reflected in the form of additional concussion hits. This is meant to show the gradual weakening brought about by shock, bleeding, and pain. This is often referred to as “bleeding.”</li>
<li> Next swing/roll/attack can refer to a missile attack, maneuver, or spell attack as well as to a melee attack.</li>
<li> If a target takes a critical result that lasts for a certain number of rounds and he has not yet performed his action for the current round, the current round counts as one of the rounds affected by the result. Otherwise, the effects begin the round after the critical is received.</li>
<li> If an item is indicated as being destroyed by a critical result, it is automatically destroyed unless it is made of an extraordinary material (e.g., Mithril) or it is incredibly magical (i.e., an Artifact). In this case, if the GM allows it, the item may make a RR as described in Spell Law Section 8.5 to avoid destruction.</li>
</ul>
<h4>CRITICAL &amp; FUMBLE RESULTS</h4>
<p><a href="#AL_4">Section 4.0</a> for a detailed description of how to interpret the critical results.</p>
<h4>EFFECTS OF “STUN” ROUNDS</h4>
<p>During play a combatant may be “stunned” for a number of rounds due to critical strikes (this includes all “Stunned” rounds, all “Stunned No Parry” rounds, and all “Down” or “Out” rounds). All of these “stuns” due to multiple critical strikes are cumulative. Normally the total number of rounds of “stun” decreases by one each round, with the most severe type of “stun” taking effect first.</p>

<h2><a name="AL_5.7">5.7</a> MANEUVERING AND MOVEMENT</h2>
<p>Complete maneuvering and movement guidelines can be found in the <em><strong>Rolemaster (RM)</strong> Standard Rules</em>. In this section, we present a summary of those guidelines as they apply to combat situations.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.7.1/Maneuvering" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.7.1">5.7.1</a> Maneuvering</h3>
<p>In this section we only present guidelines for moving maneuvers and how they apply to combat.</p>
<h4>ASSIGNING A DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY</h4>
<p>When a combatant indicates that he wishes to attempt a maneuver, the GM should assign a degree of difficulty and any special modifications he feels apply. The degree of difficulty is chosen from those listed across the top of the Maneuver/Movement Chart and listed below.</p>
<p align="center">Routine<br />Easy<br />Light<br />Medium<br />Hard<br />Very Hard<br />Extremely Hard<br />Sheer Folly<br />Absurd</p>
<p>If the combatant decides not to proceed with the maneuver, he may cancel his action as described in <a href="#AL_5.3.5">Section 5.3.5</a>. Otherwise, the combatant makes a maneuver roll. After the maneuver roll is modified by applicable bonuses and penalties (see Maneuver Modifications Chart), the net maneuver roll is cross-indexed with the degree of difficulty on the Maneuver/Movement Chart to obtain the result.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> It is important to remember that certain maneuvers may be deemed impossible by the GM. The player should be advised by the GM that such a maneuver is doomed to failure.
</blockquote>
<h4>MANEUVER ROLL</h4>
<p>The outcome of an attempted maneuver is resolved by making an open-ended roll, 1-100. The result of this roll is the maneuver roll.</p>
<h4>MANEUVER BONUSES AND PENALTIES</h4>
<p>Attempted maneuvers can be affected by various factors such as skills, armor and special equipment. Bonuses and penalties for these factors are outlined in Maneuver Modifications Chart. The sum of these bonuses and penalties is added to the maneuver roll to determine the net maneuver roll.</p>
<h4>MANEUVER RESULTS</h4>
<p>The net maneuver roll is cross-indexed with the degree of difficulty on the Maneuver/Movement Chart. The result is usually self-explanatory, but a percentage result (i.e., a number) can be interpreted in several ways by the GM.</p>
<ul>
<li> In the case of an all-or-nothing maneuver (i.e., no partial success) a second dice roll must be made. If this second roll is equal to or less than the original result, then the maneuver succeeds. Otherwise, the maneuver fails.</li>
<li> If a maneuver can be partially successful, then the original percentage result is the degree of success.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MANEUVER PROCEDURE SUMMARY</h4>
<ol>
<li> The player states the nature of his maneuver.</li>
<li> The GM assigns a degree of difficulty and any special modifications to the maneuver.</li>
<li> The player decides whether or not to cancel the maneuver.</li>
<li> If he decides not to cancel the maneuver, an open-ended maneuver roll is made.</li>
<li> All applicable modifications are made to the maneuver roll.</li>
<li> The net maneuver roll is cross-indexed with the degree of difficulty on Maneuver/Movement Chart.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a combatant attempts to leap 15 feet over a chasm 11 feet wide. The GM assigns the leap a degree of difficulty of “Medium.” If the combatant does not cancel his maneuver, his roll will be modified by -10 for wearing a chain shirt (AT 13; see the Armor Chart), by +25 for a excellent Agility, and by -10 for being wounded (over 25% of hits). He rolls a 91 for a net maneuver roll of 96 (91 - 10 + 25 -10). Cross-indexing on the Maneuver/ Movement Chart, we get a result of “80”. This means that the combatant has leaped 12' (15' x 80%) and therefore has crossed the chasm safely.<br />
If this maneuver had been to throw a rope around a rock on the other side of the chasm and the same result had been obtained, then a second dice roll would have been required. If the second roll (unmodified) was 80 or less, then the rope throw would be successful; otherwise, it would fail.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.7.2/Movement, Encumbrance, and Exhaustion" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.7.2">5.7.2</a> Movement, Encumbrance, and Exhaustion</h3>
<p>This section deals with tactical movement (i.e., movement on a round by round basis) and the effects of carrying encumbering loads and the results of exertion and exposure to severe elements.</p>
<h4>MOVEMENT</h4>
<p>A character’s movement rate in a given round is based upon his Base Movement Rate (Base Rate), his Pace, and possibly a maneuver roll. A character’s movement rate for a given round is obtained by multiplying the character’s Base Rate by his Pace (and possibly modified by the result of a maneuver roll).</p>
<p><strong>Movement Rate</strong> = [Base Movement Rate] <strong>x</strong> [Pace Multiplier] <strong>x</strong> (Maneuver Roll Result / 100)</p>
<p>The assumptions made for this movement system are:</p>
<ul>
<li> a 100 Quickness for a 6' tall Common Man will result in a “world class” sprinter.</li>
<li> the average character (quickness 25-74) walks at 3.43 miles per hour.</li>
</ul>
<h4>BASE MOVEMENT RATE</h4>
<p>The Base Movement Rate for an average Common Man is 50' per round. This can be modified for specific characters by a number of factors: the Quickness stat bonus, any race stat bonus modification, any armor Quickness penalty, a “stride” modification, and an encumbrance penalty. Each character should be able to calculate several standard Base Movement Rates for various situations (e.g., carrying all equipment, carrying weapons and armor only, having dropped backpack, etc.).</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Quickness Stat Bonus:</strong> The chart below can be used to obtain the Base Movement Rate due to stat alone. Use the character’s Quickness stat; the resulting figure is the number of feet the character can move at a “walking pace” in a round (assuming he is healthy, unencumbered, and has no armor maneuver penalty).<br />
<strong>Racial Quickness stat bonus modification:</strong> This modification is based upon a character’s race and is added directly to a character’s Quickness stat bonus and thus directly to the character’s Base Movement Rate. This bonus should range from -10 to +15 (assigned by the GM).<br />
<strong>Armor quickness penalty:</strong> This penalty can modify the Base Movement Rate, but only to the extent of canceling the Quickness stat bonus (and racial bonus). In other words, if only the Quickness stat bonus (and racial bonus) and the armor bonus penalty (see the Armor Chart) are considered, the resulting Base Movement Rate can not fall below 50' per round. The Base Movement Rate can fall below 50 because of other factors (e.g., stride, encumbrance).<br />
<strong>Stride Modification:</strong> The Base Movement Rate is also modified for a character’s length of stride. This factor should be used whenever racial adjustments are used (e.g., Halflings often have large Quickness bonuses and will move disproportionately fast considering their short strides). For purposes of this rule, simply note that the stride of the average 6' person is used as the norm; every 6" difference will result in an add or subtraction of 5.<br />
<strong>Encumbrance Penalty:</strong> A character’s Base Movement Rate may be reduced due to the amount of weight he carries. This factor is discussed in the next section.
</blockquote>
<h4>PACE</h4>
<p>Each round a character must decide the Pace at which he wishes to move. This Pace has three effects on actions during that round:</p>
<ul>
<li> Determines the movement rate (pace multiplier x Base Movement Rate);</li>
<li> Determines the difficulty of any movement maneuver required; </li>
<li> Determines how many “exhaustion points” are expended (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>The following chart summarizes those effects:</p>

<p>Encumbering loads (see below) and armor will prevent anyone from reaching certain speeds (regardless of their bonuses). A super character with racial adds to his +25 bonuses for Quickness and Strength may move quite far while walking, even while burdened with armor and a heavy load. Nonetheless, he could not move at either a “Fast Sprint” or “Dash” rate (depending upon his armor). The following prohibitions apply.</p>
<h4>MOVEMENT MANEUVERS</h4>
<p>Use the maneuver chart for movement under pressure. Where an individual is “under pressure” from attackers, the weather, or some other perceived threat—or time is a major factor—have him roll on the Maneuver/Movement Chart. Simply determine the appropriate difficulty (from the Pace Chart, or by GM assignment); the result is the percentage of the distance they would normally move given their rate of speed. It is possible to move faster than normal due to this process.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Bandring is fleeing from the dreaded Perilous Puffin. He has a Base Movement Rate of 60'/rnd, he is running, and thus he would normally move 120' per round. Due to the pressure of the chase, however, the GM asks him to roll on the Maneuver/Movement Chart. Bandring knows the terrain, so the difficulty is “Easy” (see Pace Chart). Bandring rolls an adjusted D100 and the result is '100'. He moves the full 120 feet. Had he rolled lower and gotten a '50' result, he would move but 60' that round. Had the chase been at night a higher difficulty category may have been applicable.
</blockquote>
<h4>ENCUMBRANCE</h4>
<p>The problems associated with wearing armor and other coverings (“non-dead” weight) are covered elsewhere (see the Maneuver/Movement Chart and the Armor Chart). Encumbrance deals with “dead weight,” that which one carries rather than wears. The encumbrance penalties discussed here apply to the Base Movement Rate (see above).<br />
Basically, each character has a “weight allowance” equal to 10% of his own weight. If he is carrying dead weight less than or equal to his weight allowance, he has no encumbrance penalty. A character’s encumbrance penalty is based upon the number of increments of “weight allowance” that the dead weight consists of(seechartbelow).Acharacter’sStrengthstatbonusmaycancel some or all of his encumbrance penalty.<br />
The following steps should be taken to calculate encumbrance penalties.</p>
<ol>
<li> Calculate the normal body weight for the character.</li>
<li> Calculate the character’ s weight allowance (10% of his weight).</li>
<li> Determine how much “dead weight” (in pounds) the character is carrying; this is his “load.”</li>
<li> Divide the load by the weight allowance.</li>
<li> Determine the encumbrance penalty using the chart in the next column.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<strong>Strength Stat Bonus:</strong> Once a character has determined his encumbrance penalty, his Strength stat bonus may be used to cancel all or part of this penalty (see <a href="#AL_2">Chapter 2.0</a> for the chart to figure the bonus).
</blockquote>
<h4>EXHAUSTION</h4>
<p>Movement under extreme conditions, in rough terrain, and/or at accelerated rates will increase fatigue. For this reason, here are rules for exhaustion. Also included are provisions for exhaustion due to melee and bow fire.<br />
Each person has a base number of exhaustion points equal to his Constitution stat. This is the number of points he can expend before he has to rest and/or recuperate. (e.g., when fully rested a character with a Constitution of 90 would have 90 exhaustion points). Characters who have used all of their exhaustion points are at -100 to all activities and must rest. Exhaustion points may be recovered at a rate of one per round rested.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Exhaustion due to Pace:</strong> Each round that a character moves he expends exhaustion points at a rate determined by his Pace. This rate ranges from 1 every 30 rounds for a Walking Pace to 40 per round for a Dash Pace. These rates are listed in the Pace Chart (see above). A character without sufficient exhaustion points to complete a full round at a given pace cannot travel at that rate of speed.
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> An unencumbered Firebrass travels 50' per round (i.e., his Base Movement Rate is 50) when walking. His Constitution is 90 and he can walk for 2700 rounds (450 minutes) without a rest but he would be totally exhausted thereafter. If he were to sprint he could move at a rate of 150' per round; but he would exhaust his 90 exhaustion points in 18 rounds (3 minutes) at that pace (5/ round x 18 rounds = 90). If Firebrass were moving in a breastplate and with a 3x weight allowance load, his Base Movement Rate would be reduced to 20' per round and he would have to “Sprint” (and exhaust himself as indicated) in order to cover 60' per round.
</blockquote>
<strong>Exhaustion and Combat:</strong> When fighting, a character necessarily expends more energy than he would while walking. Thus, the following expenditures should apply.<br />
<strong>Exhaustion modifiers:</strong> The following factors may affect the way a character expends exhaustion points. They provide detail, but may be considered optional. Only one modifier of a given type should be applied (e.g., one temperature modifier, one terrain modifier, one time without sleep modifier).
</blockquote>
<h4>SUMMARY</h4>
<p><strong>Base Movement Rate</strong> = 50 feet per round <br />
+ Quickness stat bonus<br />
+ race Quickness stat bonus<br />
+ stride modification<br />
+ encumbrance penalty<br />
+ armor Qu penalty (see Armor Chart)<br />
+ Strength bonus (only cancels previous 2 modifications)</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Bandring is a <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Man,_High">High Man</a> (race Quickness stat bonus of -5) with a Quickness of 90 (stat bonus of +10). He is 6'7" tall so his stride modification is +5. His weight is 220 pounds and he is carrying 27 pounds of dead weight; thus his encumbrance penalty is -10, since 27 lb. is between 1x and 2x his weight allowance of 22 lb. (10% of his weight of 220). His Strength of 85 (bonus +5) plus his race ST stat bonus (+10) will cancel this encumbrance penalty, but it will not add anything to the Base Maneuver Rate. Bandring wears AT 14 with a standard Quickness Penalty of -10. This armor penalty is reduced to -5, since 5 of this penalty is canceled by his Strength bonus of +15 and because his encumbrance penalty was only -10. His armor QU penalty can never exceed -5 because his total QU bonus is only +5.<br />
So his Base Movement Rate is: 55 = 50 (standard movement rate) + 5 (stride modification) +10 (Qu stat bonus) -5 (race Qu stat bonus) -10 (encumbrance penalty) -10 (armor penalty) +5 (St stat bonus) +10 (race St stat bonus).
</blockquote>
<h4>MOVEMENT PROCESS SUMMARY</h4>
<ol>
<li> Determine current Base Movement Rate (see above).</li>
<li> Determine Pace (check restrictions).</li>
<li> Movement Rate / round = (Base Movement Rate) x (Pace multiplier).</li>
<li> If pressure situation, make a maneuver roll.</li>
<li> Expend exhaustion points.</li>

<h2><a name="AL_5.8">5.8</a> OPTIONAL RULES</h2>
<p>This section provides some optional rules for use with Arms Law. They can provide more flexibility and detail within the framework of the basic rules. However, they can involve complications and additional bookkeeping. A GM should examine these rules and determine which ones are appropriate for the pace, flavor, and detail he wishes to inject into his game.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.8.1/Changing Targets" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.8.1">5.8.1</a> Changing Targets</h3>
<p>When a character changes targets, he may take an OB mod against the new target for one attack. In all cases, the character must be aware of the new target in order to face it.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>In Fire Phase (A):</strong> If the firer attacked a target in Fire Phase (B) of the previous round and/or the Melee Phase of the previous round, he must take a -20 modification to his attack if the new target is 0" to 90" from the previous target or a -40 modification to his attack if the change is 91" to 180".<br />
<strong>In Fire Phase (B):</strong> If a character fired at a target in Fire Phase (A) of this round, he must take a -20 modification to his attack if the new target is 0" to 90" from the previous target or a -40 modification to his attack if the change is 91" to 180".<br />
<strong>In Melee Phase:</strong> If a character fired at a target in Fire Phase (A) of this round, he must take a -20 modification to his attack if the new target is 0" to 90" from the previous target or a -40 modification to his attack if the change is 91" to 180".<br />
<strong>In Melee Phase:</strong> If a character fired at a target in Fire Phase (B) of this round, the new target must be within 0" to 90" of the previous target and the character takes a -30 modification to his attack. If the change is 91" to 180", the character will be unable to melee the new target, but he can change the target’s attack (if any) to a flank attack instead of a rear attack.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.8.2/Using Missile Weapons in Melee" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.8.2">5.8.2</a> Using Missile Weapons in Melee</h3>
<p>In general, missile weapons cannot be used while engaged in melee. However, a GM may allow a relatively small one-handed weapon (e.g., a thrown dagger) to be thrown during melee in certain situations. The potential firer must be able to make a normal melee attack (e.g., may not have performed earlier actions that would prohibit him from making a melee attack).<br />
In such a case, the thrower’s opponent should make his melee attack first. Then the thrower should make a maneuver roll to see if he can throw. If successful, the thrower would then be allowed to throw his weapon. If this maneuver is attempted, the character may not make his normal melee attack.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.8.3/Fire While Moving" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.8.3">5.8.3</a> Fire While Moving</h3>
<p>A character using a missile (or thrown) weapon that performs no other actions in a round has the option of combining his movement with Fire Phase (B). In this way, the combatant may move up to 50% of his normal movement allowance, and fire during movement with -50 to his attack. A GM should require a maneuver roll for this action. (e.g., If the character fails the roll, he may only get part of the way through his movement, or perhaps not be allowed to fire.)</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Opponents on “opportunity fire” would have the option of firing at a character attempting such a maneuver before he would fire at them.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.8.4/RELOADING" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.8.4">5.8.4</a> RELOADING</h3>
<p>A character may attempt a maneuver to reload his weapon during any Movement/Maneuver Phase. The percentage of normal activity that is required varies for different weapons from 30% to 300% or more. Each type of reload has a required activity percentage. These “reload times” differs from those in Section 5.5 but the effects in play are approximately the same.<br />
If the activity % required cannot be completed during a single Movement/Maneuver Phase then it may be continued in the Movement/Maneuver Phase of the next round (e.g., if reloading takes 150% activity, it will take at least one full round and half the activity of another round to complete). If any other action is taken during a reloading maneuver, the reloading is canceled and must be restarted from scratch.</p>
<blockquote id="option">
<strong>Option 1:</strong> A GM may allow a character to reduce the required % activity for a reload by up to 30% of normal activity by taking a OB penalty for his next fire attack. The OB penalty is equal to the activity reduction (e.g., a reduction in reload time of 20% of normal activity would result in a -20 OB mod).
</blockquote><blockquote id="option">
<strong>Option 2:</strong> A GM may allow a character to make a maneuver roll to attempt to reload in less than the required time. We suggest that the minimum reload time be no less than half the normal amount. For example, a reload in 50% of the normal time would be a Extremely Hard maneuver, in 75% of the normal time would be a Hard maneuver, etc.

To make this factor less important, only roll 1D10; to make it more important, use more dice.</p>

This attack is treated as a Small (or possibly Medium) “Bash” attack (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-3.10">Table 3.10</a>).

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.8.8/ARMOR DAMAGE" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.8.8">5.8.8</a> ARMOR DAMAGE</h3>
<p>Armor can take a certain total number of “points of damage” before it falls apart; this will be called the armor’s endurance. A set of armor’s endurance is equal to [50 x the AT] plus [20 times the armor’s DB bonus]. Thus a +10 chain hauberk (AT 16) would have an endurance of 1000 = [50 x 16] + [20 x 10].<br />
Armor damage occurs when damage is taken by the character wearing the armor. Each concussion hit taken by the character confers 1 point of armor damage; an 'A' crit causes 10 pts, a 'B' crit causes 20 pts, a 'C' crit causes 30 pts, a 'D' crit causes 40 pts, and an 'E' crit causes 50 pts. Due to normal wear and tear, armor receives 2 points of damage for every week (or portion of a week) that it is worn.<br />
The amount of damage that a set of armor has taken can cause an increase in the severity of criticals taken by the wearer. If the damage taken totals 0%-19% (round off) of the armor’s endurance, the severity of any crits is not affected. Between 20% and 39%, the severity of any crits is increased by (one to a maximum severity of 'E'). Between 40% and 59%, severity is increased by 2; between 60% and 79%, severity is increased by 3; and between 80% and 99%, severity is increased by 4. E.g., if a set of armor takes damage equivalent to 45% of its endurance, 'A's become 'C's, 'B's become 'D's, and 'C's, 'D's, and 'E's are become 'E's.<br />
If the total damage taken by a set of armor is less than or equal to 20%, a character may repair it himself at a rate of 1% for each 2 hours spent. We suggest a cost of materials of 1% of the armor’s cost for each 10% of damage repaired. If the total damage taken is over 20% a special craftsman (someone with armor repairing skill) and equipment is required for repairs. The craftsman and equipment must be appropriate for the type of material involved; normally a smith for standard metal armor and a leather-worker for standard leather armor. We suggest a time requirement of 1 day (8-hour) per 10% repaired, and a cost of 1% of the armor’s cost for each 2% of damage repaired. For damage above 60% we suggest 1 day per 5% repaired and a cost of 3% of the armor’s cost for each 2% of damage repaired. These prices are based upon the normal price for a standard set of that type of armor. A GM may wish to make allowances for special or magical armor.<br />
For characters with “smithing” or “leather-working” skills, access to proper equipment and material should be required. In addition, the character should have to make a maneuver roll each day to see if his repair attempts have been successful.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.8.9/Effects of Stun" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.8.9">5.8.9</a> Effects of “Stun”</h3>
<p>A combatant’s <em>total hit points</em> is the number of hits he can take without becoming unconscious. A combatant will lose consciousness if his total number of accumulated rounds of “stuns” exceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
5 + [the combatant’s total hit points / 10] (round up)
</blockquote>
<p>If not unconscious due to some other cause, a combatant will regain consciousness when his total accumulated rounds of “stuns” becomes less than total above.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Croe (often called the “Dwarven Punching Bag”) “trips” and falls into an open pit. The fall does not hurt him, but the sudden stop on the solid rock at the bottom delivers two B-severity Krush criticals. In addition, the sharpened spikes someone carelessly left imbedded the bottom deliver five A-severity puncture criticals. Croe is lucky, the criticals do not do any significant damage (just a bunch of hits); however, the total number of stun rounds from the seven criticals is 17. Since Croe’s can take 77 hits before passing out, he passes out if his stun round total exceeds 13 (= 5 + (77 / 10)) rounds of stun. Thus Croe is unconscious. If nothing else happens to him, he will regain consciousness in 4 rounds (= 17 - 13).

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5520/5.9.1/Healing Guidelines" -->
<h3><a name="AL_5.9.1">5.9.1</a> Healing Guidelines</h3>
<p>A GM should develop a comprehensive healing system for his world. This is a factor that controls how many and how often characters die permanently and how long they are out of commission healing.</p>
<h4>HEALING SPELLS</h4>
<p>In a campaign game, the GM may want to make healing spells available in towns and cities. The GM should experiment with costs and requirements for healing services. This could range from spell users requiring only money for their services to spell users who will only heal “true believers” of their religion (or race). A complete set of healing spells is provided in Spell Law for healing by a variety of professions.</p>
<h4>HEALING HERBS</h4>
<p>One of the prime ingredients of a healing system is herbs (drugs). Herbs may be used to simulate the effects of certain spells in performing miraculous cures, are portable, and are usually much more available than high level healers. The GM can experiment with the numbers, prices and effects of whatever herbs he feels are necessary in his game. Below is an example some herbs found in one area of a fantasy would; other drugs might be available in other areas.</p>
<h4>NATURAL HEALING</h4>
<p>For the <strong><em>RM</em></strong> system concussion hits heal at a rate of 1 each hour if resting, and every 1 every 3 hours if active. The Healing Recovery Chart (below) gives the recovery time for a variety of injuries.</p>
<h4>EFFECTS OF INJURIES</h4>
<p>Another key factor in a healing system is the effect of the wound after being cured (by spells or herbs); some considerations in this area are: how long does it take to recover? should there be any permanent damage (often reflected in a lowering of stats)? what effect would the wound have on the character while he is recovering? Most of these questions are very subjective and must be decided on a case to case basis. For example, having an arm cut off and then reattached might cause a loss of agility (temporary or permanent) and maybe a scar. Death and being raised from the dead might cause a general loss of abilities, partial loss of experience, and scars. Due to the variety of character systems which exist, these elements will not be detailed in <em>Arms Law</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="AL_5.9.2">5.9.2</a> AD&amp;D&reg; Conversion Notes</h3>
<p>Because <abbr title="TSR Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D&reg;</abbr> is a role playing game that many people are familiar with, here are some conversion notes as an example of how <em>Arms Law</em> can be used with other FRP systems. To use Arms Law with <abbr title="TSR Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D&reg;</abbr> substitute the <em>Arms Law</em> attack tables for the <abbr title="TSR Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D&reg;</abbr> Hit &amp; Damage Procedure.</p>
<h4>WEAPON SKILL</h4>
<p>To calculate the skill with a weapon that a character has proficiency in, use the following formula.</p>
<blockquote>
OB = ([20 - THAC0] x 7) + Stat Bonus
</blockquote>
<p>To determine the stat bonus for a given weapon, look up the most appropriate stat on the chart on the next page (use Strength for melee and thrown weapon, Dexterity for missile weapons).<br />
A character has a -25 (before stat modification) with a weapon with which he has no proficiency.</p>
<h4>LEVEL BONUSES</h4>
<p>Because levels are not the same in both systems, use the following for level bonuses.</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><td>Warriors</td><td>+5 per level</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rogues</td><td>+2 per level </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mages</td><td>+0 per level </td></tr>
<tr><td>Priests</td><td>+0 – +2 per level †</td></tr>
<caption>† – depending on the nature of the diety—normal clerics would get a +3 per level</caption>
</table>
<h4>OFFENSIVE BONUS</h4>
<p>The remaining factors of OB are the same as presented in <a href="#AL_5.5">Section 5.5</a>.</p>
<h4>INITIATIVE POINTS</h4>
<p>Convert Dexterity to a 1-100 stat using the chart below.</p>
<h4>DEFENSIVE BONUS</h4>
<p>Look up the character’s Dexterity on the chart below to determine the character’s Quickness bonus portion of DB. The rest of the factors in DB are the same as presented in <a href="#AL_5.4">Section 5.4</a>.</p>
<h4>HITS</h4>
<p><em>Arms Law</em> is designed for a system in which a normal fighter will take just over 100 hits by 10th level. To accomodate for this, muliply the characters hits by 2 and add 10.</p>
<h4>GENERAL</h4>
<p>All other facets of the system remain as presented here.<br />
For conversion to any system, remember: the effectiveness, flexibility, and power of an attack is entirely contained within the offensive bonus of an attacker. So the offensive bonus should represent the potential of the attacker for inflicting damage.</p>

<h3><a name="AL_5.9.3">5.9.3</a> Martial Arts Guidelines</h3>
<h4>MARTIAL ARTS IN GENERAL</h4>
<p>In <em>Arms Law</em>, the martial arts rules have been designed to maximize playability while maintaining as many facets of real martial arts as possible. The Martial Arts Combat Summary Chart gives the combat capabilities of a sample of the martial arts existing in our world. Any other capabilities of martial artists are dependent upon the character system being used. Combat capabilities are described in terms of 2 attack tables and 2 critical tables devoted to martial arts. All normal Arms Law combat rules apply—unless they are specifically superceded by the guidelines provided in this section.</p>
<h4>THE MARTIAL ARTS “FORMS”</h4>
<p>The martial arts forms given are broad generic classifications and represent no specific style. The GM may modify any or all of the statistics given to simulate a specific martial art form. The forms given are primarily intended to provide an example of how the system can be used.<br />
We suggest that any player-character wishing to run a martial artist (warrior monk) be allowed to choose (or be assigned) one of the forms given. The fantasy character level values (experience or skill level) would determine the rate of progression of combat capabilities. Level capabilities that are not given can be easily extrapolated. It is suggested the non-trained characters be treated as novice boxers and novice wrestlers.<br />
Kung Fu is the source of most martial art forms (it has no belt system, but belts are included for comparison purposes). Kung Fu requires spiritual and mental training as well as physical training and thus the stats given are superior to the other forms (Kung Fu progresses equally in striking and sweeps and throws). It is suggested that characters wishing to be Kung Fu martial artists be given certain restrictions. Suggested restrictions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>a background (youth) spent in a religious order or retreat;</li>
<li>a specific mission in life due to the background;</li>
<li>personal enemies due to affiliation with the religion; and/or </li>
<li>a very, very strict alignment of good (or evil).</li>
</ol>
<h4>MARTIAL ARTS OBs</h4>
<p>The OBs given on the Martial Arts Combat Summary Chart include bonuses for expertise and level, but not for personal characteristics (strength, agility, etc.). A GM should examine the normal Arms Law offensive bonuses of his standard characters and compare them to the stats given. If there is a large difference, merely reduce the offensive bonuses given by 25-50%.</p>
<h4>INCREASED INITIATIVE POINTS</h4>
<p>Only martial artists may use part of their offensive bonus to increase their first strike points (see <a href="#AL_5.6.1">Section 5.6.1</a>). For every 5 points by which the martial artist decreases his offensive bonus, his initiative total is increased by 10 points. This reflects a martial artist’s capacity to focus his attack upon a very fast lethal blow.</p>
<h4>MULTIPLE ATTACKS AGAINST THE SAME FOE</h4>
<p>Certain Martial artists may make two attacks against the same foe in one round (if “Hasted,” a martial artist can make 4 attacks). Factor #1 following an OB on the Martial Arts Combat Summary Chart indicated the number of allowable attacks against the same foe. If this factors is not given for a given MA rank, the martial artist may not make multiple attacks against the same foe with that MA rank.<br />
To make multiple attacks, the martial artist must decrease his OB by 30, he must split his OB between attack and parry in the same manner for both attacks, and he must be using Martial Arts.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Aurum (Black Belt, 3rd D., Japanese) has a +100 OB in MA Striking Rank 1 (“100 2/3/180 &deg; ”) and chooses to attack Edan twice in one round. Because he is striking twice in the same round, he subtracts 30 from the OB applied to each attack (i.e., he makes two +70 MA Striking Rank 2 attacks). Of course, he may use part of his OB to parry, and he still has the option of only attacking once at +100.
</blockquote>
<h4>ENGAGING MULTIPLE FOES</h4>
<p>Only martial artists can engage multiple foes in the same round of combat, without using special abilities or aid from spells (e.g., “Haste”, etc.). Factors #2 and #3 following an OB on the Martial Arts Combat Summary Chart indicated the number of allowable foes and the maximum allowable angle of separation of these foes. If these factors are not given for a given MA rank, the martial artist may not engage multiple foes with that MA rank. To engage multiple foes, a martial artist must be using martial arts (unarmed combat) and he must subtract 20 from his OB for each foe engaged. He must also allocate his remaining OB between attack and parry in the same manner against all foes engaged.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Lauria (Black Belt, 2nd D., Korean) has a +80 OB in MA Striking Rank 1 and is fighting two foes. He can attack one with his full +80 OB or both with a +60 OB against each (80 - 20). Since the chart indicates he can engage 2 foes within 180 &deg; (“80 1/2/180 &deg; ”), he can fight the two foes regardless of their angle of separation (e.g., even against one frontal and one rear attacker).
</blockquote>
<h4>INTERPRETING THE MARTIAL ARTS COMBAT SUMMARY CHART</h4>
<p>The example below shows how the combat statistics can be interpreted using the guidelines above and the key found at the bottom of the Martial Arts Combat Summary Chart.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Consider a martial artist with a 3rd degree black belt in Japanese style karate. His DB of 60 applies to all foes that he is aware of. This example ignores weapon Kata.<br />
He could choose to fight using any one of his 8 rank abilities (4 striking, 4 sweeps and throws), or he could attempt to grapple with an offensive bonus (OB) of 50 (maximum result on the Grapple attack table of Small).
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li> With striking rank 4 and all four sweeps and throws ranks, he could only fight one target per round with the OB given.</li>
<li> However, with striking rank 3, he could:
<ol>
<li> Fight 1 foe with a 70 OB, <strong>or</strong></li>
<li> Fight 2 foes (within a 90&deg; arc) with a 50 (=70-20) OB against each.</li>
</ol></li>
<li> With striking rank 2 he could:
<ol>
<li> Fight 1 foe with an 85 OB, <strong>or</strong></li>
<li> Fight 2 foes with a 65 (=85-20) OB against each.</li>
</ol></li>
<li> With striking rank 1 he could:
<ol>
<li> Fight 1 foe with a 100 OB (1 attack), <strong>or</strong></li>
<li> Fight 1 foe with a 70 (=100-30) OB (2 attacks), <strong>or</strong></li>
<li> Fight 2 foes with an 80 (=100-20) OB (1 attack each), or 4) Fight 3 foes with a 60 (=100-20-20) OB (1 attack each).</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h4>EFFECT OF WEAPON KATA</h4>
<p>Certain martial artists use weapons as part of their Kata (kata are patterns of attack and defense that form the basis for the various forms of martial arts). Weapon kata may be used if a -20 modification is made to the OB of the particular rank being used. Normal martial arts weapons include knives (daggers), jo sticks, nunchakus, tonfas, various swords, and other exotic weapons. A GM may wish to limit which types of weapons may be used and at which level of development in martial arts training their use should begin.<br />
It is suggested that knife kata be allowed at striking ranks with an offensive bonus (OB) of at least 50, and stick kata be allowed for sweeps and throws ranks with an OB of at least 50. It is further suggested that each martial artist be allowed to pick two other appropriate weapon kata that can be utilized by a rank that has an OB of 90 or more.<br />
A weapon kata attack is resolved in the following manner.</p>
<ol>
<li> A normal attack is conducted on the appropriate martial arts attack table (striking or sweeps and throw). A OB modification of -20 is applied.</li>
<li> The weapon being used may be fumbled as specified in <a href="#AL_5.6.2">Section 5.6.2</a>-<a href="#AL_5.6.3">5.6.3</a>. However, the fumble range is decreased by 1 for each increment of 10 that the OB is over 50 (round down and the range can never be reduced below 2).</li>
<li> The number of concussion hits indicated on the martial arts attack table is increased by: the difference between the maximum number of hits the weapon can give [to the armor type (AT) being attacked] and the maximum number of hits that can be given to the AT being attacked by the martial arts attack table being used. The result is the actual number of concussion hits inflicted by the weapon kata.
<blockquote>
<strong>Kata Hits Delivered</strong> = normal MA hits +
(Max Weap. Hits vs. that AT) - (Max MA Hits vs. that AT)
</blockquote></li>
<li> In addition to the normal (if any) critical strike indicated by the martial arts attack table, a weapon kata also inflicts a second critical of one severity level less. For example, a result of C on the Martial Arts Strikes Attack Table would also inflict a B Slash (or Puncture) critical if a knife were used. <strong style="color: red;">Important:</strong> Only one die roll is made to resolve both criticals. The type of extra critical is always Unbalancing for sweeps and throw for weapons kata, while the extra critical type can be Slash, Puncture, or Krush for striking weapon kata. If more than one type of critical is appropriate for a given striking weapon kata, the attacker should choose which is to be applied—before the critical roll.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Consider a martial artist with a rank 1 striking OB of 110. He decides to use a weapon kata utilizing a morning star against a foe with an armor type (AT) of 9(-30). His OB is reduced to 90 (110-20) due to using a weapon kata (-20) found on Offensive Bonus Modification Chart). A morning star normally fumbles on 01-08; but his OB is 40 more than 50, so he would only fumble on an attack roll of 01-04.<br />
He makes an attack roll of 45, thus his net attack roll is 45 (attack roll) + 90 (OB) – 30 (defender’s DB)= 105. If he had made a higher attack roll, it would not have changed the result because the maximum result for a rank 1 attack is 105. The result from the martial arts striking attack table is “10B.”<br />
The maximum number of concussion hits that a morning star can inflict upon AT 9 is 27, the maximum for a MA striking attack against AT 9 is 19; so the actual number of concussion hits inflicted is 18 (=10+27-19).<br />
The critical damage is a 'B' martial arts Striking critical and an 'A' Krush critical are applied to the defender. Thus, if the martial artist rolled a critical result of 52; the 'B' MA Striking critical would stun the foe for 1 round and inflict 6 concussion hits, while the 'A' Krush critical would force a parry at –25 for one round and inflict 5 more concussion hits.<br />
The grand total of damage would be: 29 (=18+6+5) hits, stunned one round, and forced to parry at –25 the next round (the worst damage inflicted is applied first).

<h2><a name="AL_5.10">5.10</a> MISCELLANEOUS CHARTS</h2>
<h4>Weapon Statistics</h4>
<p>The weapons given in the historical section of the Weapon Statistics Chart are historical weapons that have actually been made and used in our world. The statistics given are suggested values for their use with <em>Arms Law</em>. They indicate which <em>Arms Law</em> attack tables to use and what modifications to make. These weapons are intended to be examples of how to use the <em>Arms Law</em> system to simulate any weapon.<br />
The weapons in the fantasy section of the Weapon Statistics Chart are fantasy (made up) weapons. They are very powerful and depend on special design and material. They are included to illustrate how you can make up your own weapons using this system.</p>
<h4>Animal and Monster Statistics</h4>
<p>The animals statistics given in the Animal Statistics Chart are for animals that have actually existed on our world. The statistics given are suggested values for their use with <em>Arms Law</em>. They indicate which Arms Law attack tables to use and what modifications to make. These animals are intended to be examples of how to use the <em>Arms Law</em> system to simulate any animal.<br />
The creatures in the Monster Statistics Chart are fantasy (made up) creatures. They are very powerful; and their use in play often depends on special abilities and the world system being used. They are included to illustrate how you can make up your own monsters using this system.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> The OBs and DBs given to monsters and animals are based upon normal Rolemaster values. In these systems, a fighter can have an offensive bonus as high as 80 to 90 at around 5th level. For use with other systems, the OBs and DBs given should be examined for their relation to character bonuses. It may be that the bonuses given should be cut to between 50-70% for some systems.
</blockquote>
<h4>Animal Statistics</h4>
<p>Most animals will rarely attack a human unless they or their young are threatened. When an attack does occur, however, it is often sudden and ferocious. The ferocity of animal attacks is reflected to a certain degree by the ten animal attack tables found in <em>Arms Law</em>. Some of these tables make huge animals more terrible than the most fearsome weapon. The comparative ferocity and prowess of animals is subject to the value judgements of the GM.<br />
The Animal Statistics Chart provides some suggested combat capabilities for common earthly animals using the animal attack charts. Only the broad physical characteristics are presented. The tactical application of the animals’ characteristics (as well as any unusual abilities) should be developed by the GM.</p>
<h4>Monster Statistics</h4>
<p>A sample of commonly used fantasy monsters is provided on the Monster Statistics Chart. This shows only the combat capabilities of the listed monsters. Any special abilities (fire-breathing, invisibility, flying, etc.) must be provided by whatever system you use in your game.</p>
<h4>Determining the Type of Attack</h4>
<p>Each animal described on the charts has at least one type of attack and possibly as many as three (Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary). To determine which attack is used, roll percentile dice (1-100). Low (and in the given percent range, the last number) indicates that the primary attack is used while the higher rolls indicate secondary and possibly tertiary attacks.<br />
The GM may always change the given pattern of attack for a given animal or situation; the provided values are only meant to be guidelines for the use of the attack tables.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Examine the Wolverine entry. On a roll of 1-40 the wolverine will use the Bite Attack Table with an offensive bonus of 50 and a Maximum result of Medium (M). On a roll of 41-50, the wolverine will use the Claw/Talon Attack Table with an OB of 45 and a Maximum result of Medium. On a roll of 51-100, the Wolverine will make both of the attacks.
</blockquote>
<p>An attack marked with a « or √ can as a result of another attack by the same animal has already obtained a critical strike this round.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>«</strong> — If the attack given on the left (i.e., the primary attack for a secondary attack or the secondary attack for a tertiary attack) has obtained a non-Tiny critical this round, then this attack occurs in the same round.<br />
<strong>√</strong> — If the attack given on the left (i.e., the primary attack for a secondary attack or the secondary attack for a tertiary attack) has obtained a non-Tiny critical this round, then this attack occurs in the following round.<br />
<strong>opt</strong> — The creature may use this attack (usually a weapon) if it desires (usually determined by the GM).
</blockquote><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A Gorgon attacks a man. On its first round of attack it has a 100% chance of using its Medium Horn attack with a 40 OB (“40MHo100”). It gives the man a “10AP” result. Since it got a non-Tiny critical result, it makes a Large Bash attack with an OB of 60 (“60LBa«”); otherwise, it would not have gotten any more attacks in the first round. With the large bash attack, it gives the man an “11BU.” Since the Gorgon got a non-Tiny critical with its large bash attack, it will get to make a Large Trample- Stomp attack with a 50 OB next round (“50LTs √”).
</blockquote>
<h4>Converting and Creating Creatures</h4>
<p>Trained or usually intelligent animals may have higher offensive bonuses and use different combinations of attacks than those presented on the charts. These statistics are only meant to be a sample and the GM should feel free to use the provided tables for describing and designing his own animals and monsters.<br />
A good rule of thumb for converting monsters is to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Determine the size (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, or Huge) and type of attack.</li>
<li> Determine the Maximum damage for each type of attack (usually the size).</li>
<li> Determine an appropriate offensive bonus. If this cannot be easily set, approximate it by +10 per hit die that the creature normally has under your system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following charts can also be useful in handling Arms Law creatures during play and in converting other creature statistics into <em>Arms Law</em> statistics.</p>
<h4>LARGER/SMALLER THAN NORMAL ANIMALS</h4>
<p>The statistics given for animals apply in general to the size and nature of the animal found in our world. For creatures smaller than normal (e.g., a baby elephant), decrease the Size, Hits, and Max (on attacks), but leave the pattern of attack the same. Similarly, for larger than normal animals (e.g., giant crabs, huge birds, giant spiders, etc.) increase the Size, Hits, and Max (on attacks), but leave the pattern of attack the same. The OBs for various attacks should be decreased for smaller animals and increased for larger animals.</p>
<h4>ATTACKS BY GROUPS OF SMALL ANIMALS</h4>
<p>Swarms or groups of tiny creatures (Bees, Ants, etc.) may be given a small attack on the appropriate table. Some of these “swarm” attacks are indicated on the charts (Bees, Birds, Crabs, Lizards, etc.).</p>
