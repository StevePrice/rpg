<h2>Academic (Modern)</h2>
<h4>Black Ops:</h4>
<p>The Academic specializes in the non-scientific areas of academic endeavor. Academics usually end up doing one of three jobs (or a combination thereof): writer, researcher, or teacher. Academics, like scientists, can travel throughout the world in search of knowledge without raiging too many suspicions. A foreigner abroad that is doing "research" for a thesis or book might even able to get access to information or places normally off-limits to others.</p>

<h2>Academic (Pulp)</h2>
<h4>Pulp Adventures:</h4>
<p>Academics are non-spell users whose main pursuit in life is the acquisition of knowledge. They ordinarily fill a non-combative role, but rely on the maxim "mind over matter" when pressed into action. Education is essential; all academics will have completed at least four years of college-based education, and should have a particular field of endeavor that they specialize in. Academics are firm believers in science and technology. Thus they have better than average skills when manipulating mechanical devices. They usually specialize in a given field, be it anything from Archaeology to Psychology to Zoology.</p>
<p>An Academic may also find himself on the other side of the chalkboard, educating the masses for the sake of humanity and culture as a teacher, or work behind the scenes as a researcher. They often revel in their lifelong passions, collecting specimens the world over for their private collections, whether a rare tome on esoteric magic or a fossil of some extinct flora or fauna.</p>

Ifthe levies were deprived o f the leadership o f their officers and the support of the mercenaries, their rout was inevitable.

<blockquote><p>Rylara stood on the battlements of the East Tower, gazing at the star-filled sky, mentally tracing the familiar patterns of the constellations as she waited for the rising of the moons. She reflected on the horoscope that she had earlier castfor the newborn prince and the incomplete and inaccurate interpretation she hadgiven to the Council. Let the Regents believe Prince Joram would be weak-willed and unhealthy, a willing toolfor their ends, rather than their nemesis. In the east, rose the blood-red moon.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Technician (Pulp)</h2>
<h4>Pulp Adventures:</h4>
<p>This profession specializes in the repair and design of equipment in a specialty area. Technicians are more able to analyze and understand new items, as well as construct items of a technical nature. They also spend much of their time developing other people's ideas with their in-depth design skills. This is the perfect profession for a gadgeteer.</p>

Some literary examples of Thieves might include Will Scarlet and Bilbo Baggins.</p>
<blockquote>
Vylan was stalking quietly through the streets. They were mostly deserted at this hour of the morning, but you never know when you would chance upon a merchant who was trying to open his shop early. The serpent, Slith, was coiled around his upper arm. Vylan and Slith stopped at the side of the jeweler’s shop; the window was still partially opened, just like he left it.
