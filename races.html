<a name="Orcs,_Common"></a>
<h2>COMMON ORCS</h2>
<p>Common Orcs fear the sun and make their dwellings in caverns beneath the mountains. Their myriad tribes prey upon the world of men, often prompted merely by a greed for plunder.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Heavy, with thick hides, short legs, and long, thin arms. They have grotesque, fanged faces and random hair growth. Males and females average 65 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Black or grey hair, black or reddish-brown eyes, and deep grey or black hides.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Tremendous. They can travel for 2 days without sleep. +20 to exhaustion points (see <a href="../books/5500.html#RMSR_22.3">Section 22.3</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Males and females average 4'.</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Indefinite; certainly hundreds of years, but the nature of their warlike life permits few to live past the age of 50.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> +30 DB and RR bonuses versus heat and cold attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Common Orcs sleep during daylight hours, although they need sleep only once every 3 days (more often to restore Power Points). Common Orcish vision in most darkness is as good as a Man’s during the height of day. When there is barely any light (cloudy, moonless nights; upper caverns, dungeons), Common Orcs can see at least 50' perfectly and fairly well up to 100'. In absolute darkness, they can see 10’.</p>
<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Skins, leathers, and metal armor—crude, but well made and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Natural sunlight and deep, running water. In full daylight, they only have 60% of normal activity each round; in artificial or magical daylight, they only have 80% of normal activity each round.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Bred as laborers and warriors, Orcs respect power and terror above all things. They join and cooperate in substantial groups only when led by a “focused will,” some overwhelmingly strong individual. To them, politics equates with force, and separate Orc tribes often war. Inter-tribal cannibalism is the norm.<br />
They are, however, quite skilled. Their smiths rival those of the Dwarves and Elves and, although the items they produce lack beauty in form, they are exceptionally effective. Orcs are also fine healers, despite their lack of concern for scarring.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Common Orcs do not marry; they breed. The females live together in secluded areas which are nor- mally accessible only to the strongest males. In addition, the females are receptive only to the fiercest and most attractive males. This results in the strongest offspring. The many young are kept together and raised jointly by all the female Common Orcs.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Most Orcs worship Darkness and power.</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Common Orcs are cruel, jealous, petty, ambitious, selfish, and suspicious. They are almost always uncomfortable and, aside from mealtime or battle, are never happy or at peace.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="Dwarves" -->
<a name="Dwarves"></a><a name="Dwarf"></a>
<h2>Dwarves</h2>
<p>Although Dwarves are spread across the world, they are close to one another and have spawned a universal reputation for ruggedness, practicality, and unwavering loyalty. Most groups favor the rocky highlands and deep caverns of the mountains. They are superior craftsmen and they love to mine the earth for precious gems and metals to forge into weapons of strength and artifacts of beauty and power.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Short, stocky, strong, with exceptionally strong limbs. Males average 150 pounds; females, 135 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Black, red, or dark brown hair. Fair to ruddy complexion.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Tremendous. +21 to exhaustion points (see <a href="../books/5500.html#RMSR_22.3">Section 22.3</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Males average 4'9"; females, 4'5".</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 200-400 years.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Resistance against flame and ice: +30 DB and RR bonuses versus heat and cold attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Dwarves see well in extreme darkness. In the dimmest light, they can see 50' perfectly, and fairly well up to 100'. They can see 10' in total darkness (non-magical).</p>
<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Beards, sometimes braided. Long hair. Heavy garb with colorful hooded cloaks.</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Open water; they do not normally swim (-50 to <a href="skills.html#Swimmng">Swimming</a> maneuvers).</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Dwarves are superb miners and craftsmen, and unsurpassed stoneworkers. They live in tightly-knit groups and favor underground cities which are usually cut into rugged hills or mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Monogamous. Only a third of the race is female. The line is traced through the male.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Dwarves believe that each lineage has a common spirit which permeates them all and ties them together. They revere their ancestors above all other things but their maker, and believe that in each Dwarven King exists a part of his predecessors.</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Sober, quiet, possessive, suspicious, pugnacious, introspective, and often very greedy. Tenacious warriors, they fight without quarter and never retreat. Each Dwarf treats his kind as brothers and non-Dwarves as lesser beings. They enter into agreements with extreme care and honor them to the letter.</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> <em>Starting Languages:</em> Among themselves, Dwarves speak <a href="languages.html#Dwarvish">Dwarvish</a> (S8/W6), a guarded tongue. They also speak <a href="languages.html#Common-speech">Common-speech</a> (S5/W5) and <a href="languages.html#Elvish">Elvish</a> (S4/W4). <em>Allowed Adolescence Development:</em> <a href="languages.html#Dwarvish">Dwarvish</a> (S10/W10), <a href="languages.html#Common-speech">Common-speech</a> (S10/W10), <a href="languages.html#Hill-speech">Hill-speech</a> (S2/W2), <a href="languages.html#Plains-speech">Plains-speech</a> (Rank S6/W6), and <a href="languages.html#Wood-speech">Wood-speech</a> (Rank S6/W6).</p>
<p><strong>Prejudices:</strong> Orcs and Dragons are sworn enemies. In addition, they are extremely suspicious of mages and Elves.</p>
<p><strong>Professions:</strong> Dwarves do not make good Essence or Mentalism spell users. They generally scoff at the ways of Elves or other conjurers, preferring instead to use such power in the making of permanent physical items.</p>

<h4>OUTFITTING OPTIONS</h4>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Dagger, handaxe, short sword, club, war hammer, mace, crossbow, battle-axe, spear, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, war mattock, pole arm.</p>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Any. Dwarves favor chain mail. Lamellar (treat as Chain with a -5 vs. melee, +5 vs. missile) and scale (treat as Plate) are also available. Target shields and wall shields are popular.</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 2 gold pieces or a gem (aquamarine, topaz, garnet, peridot, spinel) of comparable value.</p>

<p><strong>Extra Money:</strong> Gold pieces or a gem (emerald, amethyst, ruby, sapphire, diamond) of comparable value.</p>
<p><strong>Special Items:</strong> Spell items may only contain Channeling spells. Any weapons will be of superior workmanship and forged of steel.</p>
<p><strong>Talents:</strong> Re-roll all “spell user” results. For one background option a Dwarf may select one of the following talents (both for 2 options): (1) the ability to sense the presence of mechanical traps 50% of the time (GM should roll); (2) superior orienting abilities underground, the character always knows the direction of true north and the approximate elevation of his location.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="Gnoll" -->
<a name="Gnoll"></a>
<h2>Gnoll</h2>
<p>While Gnolls generally inhabit the upper highlands, they seldom seek homes far from the surface. They are not an unfriendly folk, but it does take time before they warm to strangers. Most Gnolls pursue magicial studies and arts, but every tribe has its warriors. It is curious to note that both the males and females have the same basic physical builds.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Short and very quick. The average weight is 75 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Sparse hair, relatively dark in hue. Skin coloration is usually light (though they will darken with prolonged exposure to sunlight). Eyes tend to be dark with only slight variations in color.</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Average height of 3'2".</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 110 years.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Gnolls see well at night. In the dimmest light, they can see 100' as if it were daytime. In addition, Gnolls have an unusual ability to sense shifts in the weather (reflected by a special bonus of +25 to <a href="skills.html#Weather_Watching">Weather Watching</a> skill).</p>
<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Gnollish clothing tends to be rather mundane and practical (though they do wear brighter garb when secluded from watchful eyes).</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Gnolls tend to be very timid around strangers.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Gnolls are not generally a violent race; nor do they tend to seek material gain. They seek little except to remain at one with the earth and world around them.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> No formal marriages, though long-lasting relationships are common. Families are rarely large.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Gnolls have no formal religion; though they do worship the power of the earth and the might of nature.</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Sometimes deemed overly defensive, Gnolls are remarkably even-tempered. They are often very timid around strangers, but in the company of close friends have been known to be quite sociable.</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> <em>Starting Languages:</em> Gnolls speak their <a href="languages.html#Gnoll">own musicial language</a> (S8/W6). They also speak <a href="languages.html#Common-speech">Common-speech</a> (S7/W5) and <a href="languages.html#Plains-speech">Plains-speech</a> (S7/W5). <em>Allowed Adolescence Development:</em> <a href="languages.html#Gnoll">Gnoll</a> (S10/W10), <a href="languages.html#Gnome">Gnome</a> (S5/W4), <a href="languages.html#Dwarvish">Dwarvish</a> (S5/W4), <a href="languages.html#Elvish">Elvish</a> (S6/W5), <a href="languages.html#Black-speech">Black-speech</a> (S6/W4), <a href="languages.html#Common-speech">Common-speech</a> (S10/ W10), <a href="languages.html#Plains-speech">Plains-speech</a> (Rank S8/W6), and <a href="languages.html#Hill-speech">Hill-speech</a> (S6/W6).</p>
<p><strong>Prejudices:</strong> Gnolls have the same hatred for violent folk that many races have, and so despise Orcs, <a href="#Goblin">Goblins</a>, and others of their ilk. They are suspicious of all strangers, however, and may treat even an Elf with the same disdain as an Orc.</p>
<p><strong>Professions:</strong> Gnolls may freely select any profession in the realm of Arms or Essence (including hybrids and semi-spell users with Essence as a realm). They do not, as a rule, practice Mentalism or Channeling (though exceptions have been noted in their societies).</p>
<p><strong>Training Packages:</strong> Gnolls may normally choose from any of the Training Packages in the <em>RMSS</em> as well as the special Gnoll Training Packages.</p>
<p><strong>Special Skills:</strong> <em>Everyman:</em> any skill in the <a href="skillcat.html#Subterfuge_Stealth">Subterfuge &bull; Stealth</a> skill category; <em>Restricted:</em> any skill in the <a href="skillcat.html#Urban">Urban</a> skill category.</p>

<h4>OUTFITTING OPTIONS</h4>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Their preferred weapon is the sling, though they have been known to use the short sword, handaxe, dagger, main gauche, warhammer (though rare), club, mace, spear, javelin, short bow, any crossbow (usually light), or bola. Their racial- specific weapons include a tunch and/or a hup.</p>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Any. Gnolls favor lighter armors (particularly leathers).</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 1-2 gold pieces.</p>
<h4>BACKGROUND OPTIONS</h4>
<p>Gnolls get five background options.</p>

<p><strong>Extra Money:</strong> Gold pieces (of various mints) or small gemstones of comparable value.</p>
<p><strong>Special Items:</strong> Most special items that Gnolls acquire will be utilitarian or stealthy in nature (though they have been known to employ all types of items).</p>
<p><strong>Talents:</strong> See <a href="../books/5541.html#RC:U_6.6.4">Section 6.6.4</a> for Gnoll-specific talents (and guidelines for using them).</p>

<h2>Greater Orc</h2>
<p>As a race, Greater Orcs were breed to be very capable of independent and intelligent action. They are much more suited to the formation of societies than are <a href="Orc,_Common">Common Orcs</a>.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> While Greater Orcs have a more “human” appearance than Common Orcs, they are still heavy with cat-like eyes, fang-teeth, and thick hides. They have longer, stronger, and straighter legs than Common Orcs. Males and females average 145 pounds.</p>

<a name="Elf,_Grey"></a>
<h2>Grey Elves</h2>
<p>Less tall and lordly than the <a href="#Elf,_High">High Elves</a>, the Grey Elves are nevertheless more noble than the <a href="#Elf,_Wood">Wood Elves</a>. They are a settled people that feel a kinship for the sea (they are sometimes called the “<dfn>Sea Elves</dfn>”).</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>

The Grey Elves are less musical than the <a href="#Elf,_High">High Elves</a> or <a href="#Elf,_Wood">Wood Elves</a>, and are less skilled in forging or crafts than the <a href="#Elf,_High">High Elves</a>. Nonetheless, they are adept at all the arts and excel in their special provinces.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="Halflings" -->
<a name="Halfling"></a>
<h2>Halflings</h2>
<p>Halflings have an unclear origin, although they arose about the same time as Men. Indeed, they are said to be related to Men. They are the smallest of the races, Halflings range between 2 and 4 feet in height, and tend to be fat or pudgy. They are sometimes called “The Hairfoots” because of their large hairy feet.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> They have large and hairy feet—to the point of being furry. Males average 54 pounds, while females average 51 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Brown skin and hair. Neat and uniformly beardless. Endurance: Halflings have a subtle ruggedness which is akin to that of Dwarves and Orcs. When pushed, they can travel long distances over tough terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Males average 3'5", females average 3'3".</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 90-110 years. They become adults at 30. Resistance: Their feet and hands are almost immune to heat and cold. Accordingly, they are almost always barefoot. +30 DB and RR bonuses versus heat and cold attacks. Their innate simplicity and innocence gives them heightened resistance to magical attacks (this is reflected in their high racial RR modification).</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Dexterous, they move nimbly and quietly. Their long, strangely slender fingers allow them to craft fine handiwork and help explain their fine reputation as thieves (this is reflected in their high racial Agility stat bonus).</p>
<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> They wear linen or wool garb—shirts, pants which fall to the upper ankle, and brightly colored vests. They occasionally don hats, but rarely wear shoes or gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Halflings shy away from the bizarre or unusual, but otherwise have normal dispositions.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Generally, Halflings burrow and dig and reside in “holes.” They are capable craftsmen, but are not friends of complex machines or magic. Their vices are few: six hefty meals a day, pipeweed smoking, and bright apparel.<br />
Most Halflings enjoy the simple life of farmers, millers, and craftsmen. Workshops and sheds dot their territories, uniformly low structures, for the halflings hate towers and rarely build above the first story.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Monogamous. They trace their lines through either the male or female.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Halfling religion is without exception low-key and informal. It is actually a series of joyful celebrations centering on the gifts of Nature.</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Halflings are basically cheery, conservative, unassuming, and peaceful folk. Ambition is not part of their makeup. Most are conformists who avoid the unknown and shun adventure.</p>

<a name="Elf,_High"></a>
<h2>High Elves</h2>
<p>The High Elves are called that ostensibly because they are considered to be the most noble of the Elves. They are said to have once resided in the land of demi-gods and may still maintain close ties to those demi-gods.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Of all the Elves, the High Elves are the strongest and sturdiest of build, although they are still slimmer than Men. Males average 215 pounds; females, 175 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Most are dark haired and have greyish eyes, but a few are fair haired and blue eyed.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> They are capable of traveling 16-20 hours a day. See the general Elf description in <a href="../books/5500A.html#RMSR_A-3">Section A-3.0</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Males average 6'7"; females, 6'3".</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> They are immortal and will only die due to violence or if they weary of life and lose the will to live.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> They cannot become sick or scarred and are virtually immune to disease. +20 DB and RR bonuses versus cold attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> See the general Elf description in <a href="../books/5500A.html#RMSR_A-3">Section A-3.0</a>. High Elves are unparalleled at understanding and working with crafts. They get a special +20 bonus to their <a href="skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> skill.</p>
<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> They favor rich clothing and fine craftmanship, and often have the appearance of great wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Nothing special.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Of all the Elves, the High Elves are the most ordered. While their brethren are content to wander or mark time in quiet diffusion, the High Elves seek to build communities and states in beautiful, guarded places.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Monogamous and for life.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Informal and centered around communal celebration and personal meditation. Like the Dwarves, the High Elves are fiery craftsmen with a heightened respect for physical objects.</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Regardless of the line, all High Elves are noble of bearing and carry themselves with assurance. They are haughty and often appear to be arrogant. Of all the Elves, they are the most inquisitive and passionate, being full of a desire for experience and expertise in the arts and the ways of the world.</p>

<p><strong>Prejudices:</strong> The High Elves hate Orcs, Trolls, and Dragons above all creatures. Due to their pride they tend to look down upon non-High Men.</p>

<h4>OUTFITTING OPTIONS</h4>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Any. High Elves prefer to derive the protection given by armor from magical items (rings, bracelets, tiaras) where such are available rather than from encumbering leather or metal.</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> Gems (peridot, aquamarine, beryl, citrine, tourmaline) worth a total of 2 gold pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Extra Money:</strong> Gems (amethyst, diamond, emerald, opal, sapphire).</p>
<p><strong>Special Items:</strong> All available. Most should be constructed from fine or rare materials.</p>
<p><strong>Talents:</strong> All available. For one background option a High Elf may select the following talent: Sensitive to the Essence, the way it pools and flows; this sensitivity allows the character to be aware of the presence of any enchantments or spells (cast by Essence or Mentalism users only) within 50 feet (when he concentrates).</p>

<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> The High Men fear Death, for they are acutely aware of their own great skills and potential.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Well organized, comfortable, and centered around cosmopolitan cities and towns. High Men are traditional and well-educated—their early days are so filled with learning.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Monogamous. They often marry folk of other races. The line is traced through the male.</p>

<h2>Hillmen</h2>

<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> They are of medium to stocky build and rugged, with little body hair. Men average 175 pounds; women, 135 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> They have a tanned or ruddy complexion and brown hair.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> They are superb mountaineers and handle tough terrain with little additional effort.</p>

<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Crude wool and hide tunics with leggings. They also wear rough over-coats, short cloaks, and fur hats. The woolens are woven in bright plaids, the colors indicating the wearer’s family lines and clan. Ritual tattooing is widespread.</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Numerous superstitions, notably a fear of Darkness centering around the spirits in the earth and plants (which come forth at night).</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Hillmen are herders, hunters, and gatherers who live in extended families and reside in villages and fortified clan- holds. They use chariots. Extremely theatric, they are gifted poets, musicians, singers, and storytellers. Pugnacious, they often settle disputes by raiding, fighting, or even warring on one another (and of course others).</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Monogamous, but one must marry outside the family. Political marriages common. Line traced through the female.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Superstitious rituals devoted to a complex grouping of vengeful petty deities.

Sacrifices are widespread and the clergy are both revered and feared.</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Suspicious and self-centered, yet vocal and ani- mated. They love to talk, laugh, sing, and scream.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="Kobold" -->
<a name="Kobold"></a>
<h2>Kobold</h2>
<p>Kobolds are the smallest of the small races. They are viewed with disdain by all races; good and evil alike. However, they have a penchant for flattery and clever speech (and knives in the shadows). Kobolds have made it their life to survive in a world that views them as useless and worthless.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Kobolds are rarely taller than 3' and while similar to <a href="#Goblin">Goblins</a> in general, they have less round faces and tend to be much leaner (and of course have no problems with their feet). Both males and females have such similar builds as to be often confused.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Their ruddy skin is often dirty. Their hair is bristly and always dark in hue. Their short horns are lighter in color (but rarely grow long enough to use as an attack form).</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Kobolds have an inner resolve that is rarely displayed. They can go for up to a day and a half without sleep (and then only need half as much rest as a man).</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> A verage 2'10".</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 75 years.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> The hardy system of the Kobold is slightly more resistant to poisons and disease (a special bonus of +5 to RRs versus poison and disease).</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Like all <a href="#Goblin">Goblin</a> breeds, Kobolds have the ability to see in dim light (up to100'). In addition, they receive a special bonus of +10 to the Influence skill category (representing their ability to lie, whine, and bemoan their way out of situations).</p>
<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Though the skills of tailoring and weaving are not unknown to the Kobolds, they can rarely make anything that is better than serviceable (they will, however, steal clothes of bright colors from other diminutive races).</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Kobolds fear anyone bigger than themselves (with is practically everyone). The sun is particularly loathed (-75 to all actions while in the sunlight).</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Survival. The Kobolds have become great at it by becoming great at whining, lieing, flattering, etc. Rarely will a Kobold be truly alone (there are usually others waiting in hiding). They will often maneuver themselves into a position as a follower (where they will be quite loyal).</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Marriages are tenuous in Kobold society. Mates are often taken at a whim.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Kobolds have no organized religion, except to fear greater powers (to whom tributes are often paid).</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>

<a name="Man,_Mariner"></a>
<h2>Mariners</h2>
<p>The Mariners are descendants of <a href="#Man,_High">High Man</a> rebels who fled the southern empires. Most settled in the far south and began a long struggle for control with the native elements. Since that time, modest inbreeding with the locals has created a somewhat distinct group, although their <a href="#Man,_High">High Man</a> roots remain strong. Their heritage as sailors and merchantmen from the southern empires still influences their culture and lifestyle. They long to reclaim the southern empires.</p>
<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Strong of build. Males average 215 pounds; women, 145 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Mariners are generally fair skinned and have grey or bluish eyes and black or dark brown hair.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Considerable. They do not get seasick. Height: Men average 6'3"; women, 5'9".</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 95-190 years.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Normal.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> They get a special +20 bonus for the following skills: <a href="skills.html#Boat_Piloting">Boat Piloting</a>, <a href="skills.html#Navigation">Navigation</a>, <a href="skills.html#Rope_Mastery">Rope Mastery</a>, <a href="skills.html#Rowing">Rowing</a>, <a href="skills.html#Sailing">Sailing</a>, <a href="skills.html#Star_Gazing">Star Gazing</a>, <a href="skills.html#Weather_Watching">Weather Watching</a>.</p>
<h4>CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Mariners favor purple, red, and gold clothing made from silk or fine cotton. They wear tunics and only rarely don leggings. Men wear gold collars, while women are well-adorned with jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Disease and illness, and their own natural mortality.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Mariner culture reflects the conservative ele- ments found among southern empires’ aristocracy, only it is carried to an extreme.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Monogamous. Line is traced through male.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Mariner religion is preoccupied with Death and Darkness, and largely revolves around ancestor and hero worship. The great Ancient Kings are revered as god-like.

The dead are buried with elaborate fanfare and are laid to rest in a preserved state, one of pronounced splendor.</p>
<h4>OTHER FACTORS</h4>
