Catalyst collectors often find employment working for guilds and colleges, where large amounts of simple catalysts are expended by students and the more rare are used by the masters.</p>

<p>Misdirection, authentic-seeming tomes, mystical implements, and a glib tongue are the Charlatan's best tools in prising gold from the gullible and the greedy. To one patron, the Charlatan may claim to have uncovered the secrets of transmutation, to another the formula for eternal youth, but to both he will explain his need for monies in order to acquire the exotic ingredients and perform the necessary experiments... And once his prey is adequately fleeced, he will flee before his chicanery is discovered. Some few have added scraps of magic to their repertoire of deception, enhancing both trickery and credibility as well as masking their true intent from real masters of magic.</p>

<h2>DAREDEVIL (V)</h2>
<p>Those who risk life and limb for nothing more than fame or fortune are Daredevils. From the death-defying circus performer such as a Trapeze Artist or a Human Cannonball, to the unsung heroics of a Hollywood stuntman, Daredevils have found that the general public is thrilled by hazardous tricks and stunts. Usually the more dangerous a feat is the better it would enthuse a crowd, and they constantly try to dream up new perilous ways to excite onlookers. Out of work pilots from the Great War took up aerial acrobatics during the Pulp-era, becoming known as “Barnstormers,” and often joining Air Circuses. Circus performers began attempting dangerous stunts such as going over waterfalls (such as Niagara) in nothing more than a wooden barrel, or walking a tightrope from skyscraper to skyscraper over busy metropolitan streets. Sitting on top of a flagpole for long periods of time even became a fad during the 1920’s. The Wild West shows churned out their share of Daredevil antics: Sharpshooters, Bronco-busters, lasso-artists, and knife throwers to name a few. Famous Daredevils might include in their ranks the names of Waldo Pepper (Barnstormer), “Buffalo Bill” Cody (cowboy trick shooter), Emanuel Zacchini (Human Cannonball), Jean Lussier (Waterfall Daredevil), Douglas Fairbanks (movie actor; performed all his own stunts).</p>

<h2>DILETTANTE (L)</h2>
<p>Usually born to a noble, or rich family with a large silver spoon in his mouth, the Dilettante rarely cares about any one thing, save perhaps his personal freedom. The idle rich, he has always had the best of everything, and thus lacks many skills that make normal folks...well, normal. He is well-educated, having attended the best (usually Ivy-League) schools. Herein often lies the greatest irony; for the affairs of the Dilettante offer a most unusual “cover” for other, more shadowy practices. Many heroes are Dilettantes in their public (secret) identities, while wearing the mantle of the <a href="#CLOAKED_VIGILANTE">Cloaked Vigilante</a> or <a href="#GANGSTER">Gangster</a> to root out their foes. After all, who else would have the time or cash to traipse about everywhere seeking out enemies to thrash? The Dilettante, of course. Whether a facade masking criminal activities or crime-busting, who would suspect the spoiled rich have any interest in such matters? This cover leaves the Dilettante free to conduct his more important affairs in secret, free from the prying eyes of those who might attempt to hinder him. Famous names among the ranks of Dilettantism might include: Lamont Cranston, Bruce Wayne, Howard Hughes, Richard Wentworth, Richard Curtis Van Loan, and Alphonse Capone.</p>

Of all the mortal wayfarers in the dream realm, the Dream Traveller is most able to explore in safety, by using magic to strengthen the dream-self with the abilities of the other world; others are unprotected against the anarchy of dreams.</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember, my girl, in the dream realm things are seldom what the seem. You can't take anything for granted. Events have meaning. Colors have significance. Time follows no rules, and Nature's laws don't always apply. &mdash;What you see as a staffmight actually be a snake; what you see a snake might actually be a spear. Things mayfall up; a girl might be a ghoul. and a ghoul might be your friend. Confusing? Indeed so. And then of course some things might be exactly what they seem: in the words ofafamous Dream Traveller, "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."

With spotlights, gala premieres, awards ceremonies, and glamorous life styles, movie stars embodied all that Americans wished their lives were. Some famous entertainers include Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, Olivia DeHavilland, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Kenneth Robeson (actually Lester Dent, author of Doc Savage), and George Burns.</p>

<h2>FEMME FATALE (V)</h2>
<p>The Femme Fatale is an exercise in seduction. She (a predominantly female vocation) uses those natural gifts to play upon her victim and his resources for her own gain. The seductress will usually present herself as sympathetic to one’s plight until she has attained her goal, then will turn on her “benefactor” and betray him in some fashion, even if it is just abandonment. The Femme Fatale has little sense of morality, and will go to great lengths to accomplish her task. It is not to say she will positively attempt to hurt her victim, whether physically or emotionally, but that she is simply out for herself. If she should desire to continue the relationship, then that becomes one of the goals she will attempt to attain. Many Pulps stereotyped the role as that belonging to an Oriental enchantress, with name-tags like: The Dragon Lady, Serpent Lady, Empress of the East, etc. Infamous Femme Fatales might include: Mata Hari, Thelda Blanchet, Elsa Schneider, Princess Aura, Princess Kojii, and Ayesha-She Who Must Be Obeyed.</p>

<p>A hedge wizard is a primitive <span id="essence">Essence</span> user who has learned the trade through oral tradition and practice, not through studying dusty books. Hedge wizards are generally found in less civilized areas, though hedge wizards can thrive anywhere a grandparent teaches the old traditions to their relatives. A hedge wizard generally excels at ritual magic, while finding spell lists more difficult to learn. Since hedge wizards tend to require time to cast most of their magic. They are practiced at intimidating others, convincing them that while it may take the hedge wizard longer to cast a spell, it will be suitably nasty. Hedge wizards are sometimes confused with witches, warlocks, and shamans.</p>

<p>While a common sailor may find himself at sea thanks to the blandishments and occasional force of the press-gang, the Mariner has chosen a life on the ocean wave. Years of hard training in the skills of seamanship and the arts of navigation transform youthful midshipmen into competent sailing masters, ship's mates and naval officers, who with luck, ability, favour and perhaps hard cash, will one day command their own ship.</p>

<h2>MARTIAL ARTS STREET PERFORMER (V)</h2>
<p>The martial arts street performer is a character who uses his martial arts skills to gain money from spectators. He has a glib and agile tongue that often appears more skill ful than his martial arts skills. The martial arts street performer is also looked down upon by "more serious" (and wealthier) practitioners of the martial arts world. Yet one must cat, and it is honest work. Sometimes the performer is a martial artist who has fallen on hard times and is without patronage. Thus it can be very dangerous to bait inept street performers, as they may be skilled martial arts students new to their trade who will bitterly resent any slur on themselves and their newfound situation in life.</p>

<p>The aerial dogfights of The Great War grabbed the attention of thousands, men and women alike. Aviation was in its infancy as a field of endeavor when the Pulp-era arrived. Many ex-military pilots roamed the land with their war surplus “crates” all boxed-up (hence the name) brand-new, and performed in “Air Circuses” for the general public as “Exhibition Fliers.” Pilots like Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart became national heroes. Other famous Aviators might include: Patrick O’Malley, Cliff Secord, G-8, Eddie Rickenbacker, Jake Cutter, Howard Hughes, Bill Barnes, Baron Manfred von Richthofen, Dusty Ayres, “Mad Jack” Bannon, and Claire E.

When a deity chooses a spokesman from outside of the church it is generally because the church no longer listens to their deity as they should. People tend to scoff at prophets, thinking them mad. Clergy tend to frown on such unorthodox approaches to religion and may even persecute a prophet for heresy. A prophet finds little relief until his message gains acceptance or is proven true. For this reason, a deity only chooses followers of great faith and virtue for such a calling.</p>
