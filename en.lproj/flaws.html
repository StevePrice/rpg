<h5>From RMSR</h5>
<p>You are constantly losing things. Every week, there is a 5% chance that you have lost some poiece of equipment.</p>
<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You have a hard time paying attention to something that is not immediately threatening. You are intensely interested in one item or idea, then you get distracted and focus on something else. You tend to ignore your surroundings when something has attracted your attention. You tend to forget things. To find an item you misplaced, or recall a conversation you recently had, you must roll 1d100 (open-ended) modified by your Me bonus. lf the result is over 100, you are successful. If you fail this roll, you cannot remember. You should role play this flaw at all times. Remember that you are neither dumb nor slow, you just have a short attention span and poor concentration.</p>
<blockquote>You always seem to misplace your belongings. There is just so much that requires your attention, it is impossible to keep track of everything. You are constantly discovering new and better ways of doing things, who could be bothered with trivialities? Now let's see, where did you leave that note you just made?</blockquote>

<p>You have a severe allergy to magic. You may choose the realm that you are allcrgic to. Whenever you try to use magic from that realm (either spells or magical items), there is a 50% chance that you will drop to the ground in a convulsion. While you are convulsing, you can perform no actions. The convulsions last for d10 rounds, after which you may act normally.

You have tried using magical items to cast spells but they seem to throw you into convulsions. Luckily it does not seem like every spell harms you, just certain types.

You are not sure why pine trees causes your allergies. Other trees do not affect you much, but you are sure that pine trees provoke your allergies.

<p>You produce an aroma that immediately drives one type of animal to attack you. You cannot this smell, no matter how you try. Your smell permeates everything that can mask it, even magic. It seems that the onIy crealures that can smell this particular odor are of one type of animal. You may pick the type of animal, subject to the GM's approval. Whenever one such animal sees you, it will immediately attack ferociously. If you are near an animal's territory, there is a 50% chance that it, or a pack of them, will hunt you down.</p>
<blockquote>You never did seem to get along with wolves. You had always been told that a wolf would not attack a human unless it had little other choice, yet you have been attacked by wolves, often without provocation, Something about you, your smell perhaps, incites wolves to charge at you. Your presence compels no other animals to violence, only wolves.</blockquote>

<p>You have a great tendency towards violence when you are dealing with a stressrul situation. Whenever you are insulted or offended, or under stress, you may respond with a violent attack. Roll d100 (open-ended), add 40, and subtract triple your SD bonus. If the result is greater than 100, you have lost your temper. You must respond to the situation in a violent, although not necessarily fatal, action. It takes approximately d10 rounds of quiet for you to calm down and regain your composure.</p>
<blockquote>You have a short fuse. Your friends know this, and they do their best to avoid you when you are in a bad mood. Sometimes you get so mad that you have to hit someone or something. When some punk is hurling some insult at you about your sister, there is only one way to teach him a lesson. Usually you can keep your feelings under control, but when you cannot, people get hurt. You have spent more than one night in jail, prompting you to try to control your temper.</blockquote>

<p>You experience guilt and become depressed anytime you cause the death or injury of a human or humanoid race. You are reluctant to enter combat with them. If you harm or kill a humanoid, you will operate at a -25 for the next d10 days while you deal with your guilt.</p>

But you just cannot bear the thought of killing another being like yourself. Whenever you kill a person, all you can think of is their family, their friends, or the life they had led. You find yourself depressed for a few days before you get over it. Even if it you have no choice, you hate to kill one of your own race.</blockquote>

<p>Whenever you are in a fight, you want to see your foes die. You always use Iethal force, even in a bar fight. You make sure a defeated foe is dead. even if they already seem to be. You do not necessarily have a short fuse &mdash; you could be a calm individual. When you enter combat, however, you go for the throat. If there comes a time when you must accept a foe's surrender, you must roll d100 (open-ended) and add triple your SD bonus. If your total is greater than 100, you may prevent yourself from killing him.</p>
<h5>From MAC</h5>
<p>When you enter any type of combat, you find yourself starting to lose control. Every round you are in combat there is a cumulative 5% chance that you will seek to kill your opponent no matter what the initial conditions of the match were.</p>
<blockquote>Your foes deserve nothing better than quick death. When you enter a fight, any fight, you thirst to draw your foe's blood. You yearn to extinguish his life, ensure he never threatens anyone again. You use the most lethal force you can. You appoint yourself judge, juror, and executioner.</blockquote>

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You havea very strong desire to interact with the opposite sex. Anytime you see an attractive member (Appearance greater than 50) of the opposite sex, you must try to allure them to you, no matter what else is happening. This could lead to a serious breech of etiqueue, but you cannot help yourself. lf you feel the need to restrain yourself from seducing someone, you must roll d100 (open-ended), substract their Appearance, add triple your SD bonus, and subtract 50. lf the result is over 100, you may stop yourself from making a pass.</p>
<blockquote>There is nothing better in the world than those of the female persuasion. You love nothing more than the feeling of their soft skin against yours. You love to run your hands through their hair. You have no problem finding women &mdash; they are always around. You approach and talk to them, letting them know how wonderful you think they are &mdash; and how wonderful you can make them feel. Some, actually most, ignore you, but occasionally you will meet a serving wench with agreeable morals. Then you show her that you are not all talk. So many women, so little time ....</blockquote>

<p>You suffer from a wild lycanthropic strain. All attempts to control this condition have a -50 penalty.</p>
<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You are a were-creature. You and your GM will determine what type of creature you are. Every full moon, you transform into your beastly form. This it an uncontrollable, psychotic type of lycanthropy. While you are in your animal form, you have a bestial desire to kill and destroy. Anything you were wearing while your underwent your transformation is ripped off of your body. Anyone you bite may contract lycanthropy (set <a href="../books/5540.html"><em>C&amp;M</em></a> for more details on lycanthropy). They may make a RR versus Disease (using your level as the attack level) to prevent the infection from taking hold.</p>
<h5>From Nightmares of Mine</h5>
<p>It is usual, in a horror game, for the character to be unable to control his transformation. In a "characters-as-monsters" game (see <a href="../books/5704.html#NoM_2.4.4">Section 2.4.4</a>), the character will be more likely to have control over the process. How the character became a lycanthrope (attacked while wandering the hills, promised to an evil sorceror, cursed bloodline) can be a major character hook, and should be detailed in the character biography.</p>
<blockquote>Most everything seems normal about you, but one time every month you undergo a change. Your teeth get Ionger. Your hair gets thicker and grows remarkable amout. Your whole face grows longer. You actually change into a werewolf. While you are a werewolf you have amazing agility and can pass on your curse to people you bite. You tend to go on rampages, killing livestock, animals, even people, if they threaten you. You often wake up in some forest or on a hill wearing nothing. You have a vague memory of what happened the night before, but you are never quite certain of details.</blockquote>

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You are very susceplible to possession. There is a 5% chance per week that you become possessed by a demon. Every week, roll a d100 (open-ended) and add 5. If the result is over 100, you are possessed sometime during that week. The GM should randomly determine a day or the week to determine when the possession occur (you won't know when exactly, but you will know that sometime within a week you will become possessed). The possession lasts for 2d10 hours. While you are possessed, your body will be constantly trying to wreak havoc and cause suffering. Your possessed body does not care who it harms and will be under GM control for as long as the possession lasts. You are fully aware of what you are doing, you just have no conlrol over it. On rare occasions when it is absolulely necessary for you to force the demon out of your body, you may make a RR versus <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> (using at attack level of 20+2d10).

<p>For you, all adders have -1 applied to their normal ability (i.e., a +2 adder becomes a +1 adder, a +1 adder does nothing). In addition, all multipliers have their potency lowered by 1 (i.e., a x3 multiplier becomes a x2 multiplier, a x2 multiplier does nothing).</p>
<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You drain power from spell adders and multipliers. Any spell adder that you use has its "plusses" (or class if you are using the <a href="5601.html"><em>Treasure Companion</em></a>) reduced by one. For example, if you were in possession of a +3 adder, in your hands it would act as a +2 adder. Also, any multiplier you use will have its multiplier reduced by one, so a x2 multiplier becomes a x I multiplier. The power in the adder and multiplier will return immediately when it is given to someone without this flaw.</p>
<blockquote>You were talking with another spell caster one evening at a local lavern. Your colleague had a ring on his hand, which he claimed increased his casting power. He said it allowed him to cast twice as many spells as he could without it. You were doubtful, but he let you try it on. You felt the power enter your body, and for a second you felt like you could cast twice as many spells as you could before. The extra power drained out of you just as quickly as it entered, though. You returned the ring, remarking on how useful that would be. You were puzzled, though; why did the power drain out of you so quickly?</blockquote>

You also have a group of people who are interested in who you really are, thus making you cautious about who you disclose your identity to. The GM must ascertain that there is really a need for a secret identity, or that there is someone or something that cares about the character's real identity.</p>
<blockquote>Sometimes it is helpful for you to don another identity. During the day, people know you as Lokath, humble spice merchant. During the night, you assume your other persona. You are known as Shadow, the master thief. You use this identity to get you into places that you would be normally be prevented from entering. You have even become an official member of the thieves' Guild. You move among them, hearing their plans, receiving training from them, even teaching younger thieves. What the Thieves' Guild does not know is that you have a mission. You are waiting for the perfect opportunity to avenge your daughter's death. She was killed by a thief and you aim to find out which one and plunge your dagger deep into his stomach. You use your secret identity to further your investigotion. You only hope that noone discovers who you really are.</blockquote>

<h5>From RMSR</h5>
<p>You have 1-3 "other" personalities. All physical charactersitics (appearance, hair color, eye color) should remain the same, but stats, skills, etc. should be different. At random times, you will shift personality (GM's discretion).</p>
<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You have from one to three additional personalities. Your physical attributes like height, weight, and hair color do not change. Your non-physical attributes can all be different, as well as each of their professions. The alignment, personality, and level can vary among personalities. Each of the personalities earns experience separately; you must keep track of which personality performed which actions so you can award the appropriate experience to each personality. You and the GM must decide what triggers the change in your personalities.</p>
<h5>From Nightmares of Mine</h5>
<p>This flaw can be an explanation for a Missing Time character hook. With the player's permission, one of the split mersonalities can be in league with the campaign's forces of evil, although this makes running the character a special challenge.</p>
<blockquote>You have a slight mental problem. Whebever you encounter a stressful situation, you have a tendency to hide your personality and replace it with a completely separate identitY. You are not conscious of this, of course. You may not even know of the other personalities or you may think of them as actual people. It does not seem to hamper you in any way, other than really confusing those around you. Maybe someday, you can be convinced of your problem and then you could seek counceling.</blockquote>

<h5>From Pulp Adventures</h5>
<p>Your whole life has been one strange occurrence after another. You seem to attract the strange, the bizarre, the just plain weird. If aliens were ever to land on Earth, they would unerringly pick your backyard; if someone lost some ancient and powerful relic, you would stumble over it while looking for your wallet. You have a rough time keeping up relationships, be they romantic or platonic, because you are constantly breaking off appointments due to some unforeseen and quite unbelievable circumstance. For whatever reason, you are a magnet to the weird. When something unusual must happen, chances are it will happen to you. Strange packages delivered in the middle of the night, ominous premonitions and dreams, or mystic possessions are just some of the occurrences that your character might encounter. It is up to the GM to fit this flaw into the campaign. This will usually help to introduce your character into a particular adventure, but most of the time strange things occur just because, and of course, when you least expect it. The oniy limitation to these happenings is that they not be immediately fatal; otherwise the GM has free reign.</p>
<blockquote>Being hit by lightning was not, in itself, strange. Being hit twice in one week was. Since that day you began to notice more and more odd things going on around you. Once, while innocently relaxing on a tropical beach you accidentally discovered a mystic talisman that washed up next to you on the shore. The tribal assassins that came looking for it made your life rather hectic. You were finally able to dispatch them and get rid ofthe cursed amulet, but you have the feeling that it's just a matter of time before something else bizarre finds its way into your life.</blockquote>

<p>You are superstitious, often reading omens into anything you encounter. You always observe the various good luck and bad luck practices of your culture. Your mood and morale are often affected by these omens.</p>
<blockquote>You feel forces in the world that control your destiny. You also feel that these forces are fickle and must be appeased whenever possible. You are not considered crazy, just overly concerned wilh omens and luck. You often throw soil over your shoulder if it is spilled. You are constantly knocking on wood. If a black cat crosses your path or you walk under a ladder, your whole doy feels ruined. One of your greatest fears is that you will accidentally break a mirror. You are flat sure what seven years of bad luck would do to you. On the other hand, you do have a rabbit's foot and horseshoe with you at all times, so maybe you can ward off those evil spirits.</blockquote>

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You are extremely difficult to wake up. You cannot be awakened while you are sleeping (or meditating). In addition, you have to sleep (or medilate) at least 6 hours every night. If you are somehow (perhaps, magically) awakened before receiving a full 6 hours of sleep, you will be at -10 for every hour less than 6 you slept.</p>
<blockquote>You are an exceptionally sound sleeper. Your comrades find it very difficult to wake you when you have fallen asleep. During one battle in the middle of the night, your comrades had to carry your sleeping body away with them when they fled the attack. You have had water thrown at you, been slapped, even had spells cast on you without waking up. In fact, you failed to notice those attempts. You really enjoy sleeping.</blockquote>

You can glow as bright as a campfire at times. You find it helpful when you need to see at night, but if you are trying to hide from someone, glowing certainly makes it easier for them to find you. You believe that your family was cursed years ago, and you are trying to find out how to reverse the condition.</blockquote>

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p> You have taken a vow either to do or not do something. This is a vow that you believe in very slrongly and has been scaled through some formal ritual. Your vow may end after a certain task is accomplished (avenge the death of your parents) or may be life-long (vow of silence). You cannot take a Vow to accomplish some task and also take the same task as your <a href="talents.html#Lifetime_Goal">Lifetime Goal (see the appropriate Talent)</a>. You must always follow your vow. If you do not, you will penalized by the GM. the vow you have made will not inconvenience you much in your daily activities (e.g., giving 10% tithe to the church, showing respect towards politicians, or never wearing black clothes, etc.). If you fail to fulfill a vow at any time, some calamity will fall on you. The severity of the calamity depends on the severity of the vow you took. The Gamemaster must give the final approval for any vow you wish to take.</p>

<blockquote>As a member of the church, you took a vow of poverty. Anytime you come across more than enough money to feed, clothe, and shelter yourself, you always give it to others. You need no material possessions. The spiritual rewards you receive are more than adequate payment for your services. There are people who cannot see why you would just give money away, since you worked quite hard for it. They cannot see the higher power at work in your life. You set a noble example for others to follow.</blockquote>

<p>While you can operate normally with respect to concentration, you often get headaches and nosebleeds after extended periods. After you finish concentrating on any task that required concentration to complete, there is a chance you will get a serious headache and/or nosebleed. The chance is equal to 1% per round spent in concentration on the activity. This results in a special modification of -10 to all maneuvers for the next hour. In addition, all spells that you cast in the next hour will require a Spell Casting Static Maneuver.</p>
